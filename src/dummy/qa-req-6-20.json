For comparison, two index lines (1990 value = 100) are included: the first refers to country specific emissions, while the second expresses total EU emissions.\n Not assessed\n  \nAssessment\n Data sources\n Metadata\n Denmarks green transition has accelerated since 1990. The 2025 Danish climate inventory and projection estimates that total emissions in Denmark for 2023 amounted to 38.8 Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 eq), corresponding to a reduction of approximately 51.0% in 2023 compared with 1990; when excluding the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector, this figure becomes 39.3 Mt CO 2 eq, corresponding to a 45.8% reduction compared with 1990.  Thus, Denmark achieved its interim target of a 5055% reduction by 2025 two years in advance.  In 2030, Danish total net emissions are estimated to amount to 22.2 Mt CO 2 eq, corresponding to a reduction of approximately 72% compared with 1990 .  Therefore, Denmark is on track to meet the national climate target of a 70% reduction in total emissions by 2030, compared with 1990 levels.\n To achieve its climate goals, Denmark has introduced a high and uniform carbon dioxide tax on industry .  Building on this foundation, the green tripartite agreement agrees to implement the worlds first CO 2 eq tax on agriculture. ><end||s><|s5|><Furthermore, EU obligations related to the LULUCF Regulation are expected to be met, and the measures contribute to further overachievement in terms of the burden-sharing agreement.\n - Total GHG emissions and removals in the EU , EEA\n Topics\nClimate change mitigation\n Forests and forestry\n Land use Geographical coverage\n - Denmark Temporal coverage\n 1990-2023\n Related content\n References and footnotes\n - Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities, Klimastatus og -fremskrivning 2025, Copenhagen, 2025, accessed 1 July 2025, https://www.kefm.dk/Media/638816066524560592/KEFM_KF25_DEL1_300425_.pdf .\n ---\nDOCUMENT 22: EU progress under the HFC phase-down set out in the F-gas Regulation | 2.5 Ozone-depleting substances and fluorinated greenhouse gases | Europe's environment 2025 (EEA)\n Source: Website\n This graph shows the progress of the hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) phase-down under EU F-gas Regulation.\n * HFC: hydrofluorocarbon\n * POM: placing on the market\n * RACHP: refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump\n Data shown for 2023 are preliminary and subject to further validation by the European Commission.
