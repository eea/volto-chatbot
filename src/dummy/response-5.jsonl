In contrast, higher living standards led to increases in emissions from transport and waste management, while the emission sinks in land use, land use change and forestry decreased. In recent years, the coal phase-out has proceeded, with the closure of all coal mines and the decommissioning of two major coal power plants. As a result, the remaining energy mix in the countrys power and heat generation has become one of the least carbon-intensive in the EU .\nThe policy target set for 2030 is likely to be achieved through the electrification of industry (mostly in the production of iron and steel) and the completion of the coal phase-out in heat generation. This needs to be accompanied by improvements in energy efficiency. Waste management and agriculture will also contribute by reducing methane emissions.

In 2021, Serbia suffered a severe drought that caused widespread crop failures. The drought is estimated to have cost the Serbian economy over EUR\u00a0500\u00a0million in lost agricultural output. Finally, during 2022, Serbia experienced a heatwave that caused widespread wildfires. The wildfires caused an estimated EUR\u00a0200\u00a0million in damage, including the loss of over 10\u00a0000\u00a0ha of forest.

After a local peak in GHG emissions in 1996 due to an economic rebound, energy efficiency actions were implemented and a slow decrease was observed, with a subsequent stabilisation at the level of about 400\u00a0Mt\u00a0CO 2 eq. This was accompanied by steady economic growth, resulting in emission decoupling. In 2009, GHG emissions decreased, reflecting the worldwide economic slowdown. In 20162018, emissions increased, mainly due to economic recovery, the rising number of vehicles and an increase in fuel use. Emissions dropped in 2020 due to COVID-19 and the consequent downturn in fuel consumption and industrial production. After an increase in 2021, due to an economic rebound, there was another drop in 2022, caused by the economic disruption triggered by Russias war of aggression against Ukraine. The main factor was a decrease in fuel use, primarily in electricity and heat production and in households: hard coal consumption decreased by 7% in electricity and heat production and by 16% in households. In 2023, GHG emissions dropped by 8%, mainly due to reductions in the consumption of hard coal (by 14%) and lignite (by 26%) . Implementing the updated national energy and climate plan should achieve a 50.4% GHG emission reduction from 1990 levels by 2030 .\n- Total GHG emissions and removals in the EU , EEA\nTopics\nClimate change mitigation\nForests and forestry\nLand use Geographical coverage\n- Poland Temporal coverage\n1990-2023\nRelated content\nReferences and footnotes", "blurb": "The indicator shows the trend in total greenhouse gas emissions, excluding those from the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector.

Therefore, Denmark is on track to meet the national climate target of a 70% reduction in total emissions by 2030, compared with 1990 levels.\nTo achieve its climate goals, Denmark has introduced a high and uniform carbon dioxide tax on industry .

In Slovakia, most of the sinks come from forests and forest land.

The main reason is the age structure of the forests, as the ageing forests need to be restructured and close-to-nature management needs to be applied on a substantially higher scale. Forests have been infested by bark beetles and suffered major storm damage, such as in 2004, when a considerable part of the forests in the High Tatras fell during a storm.\n The policy target for 2030 is very unlikely to be achieved. Based on the current modelling results , achieving the goal would require the large-scale application of different measures across all types of land in combination with an approximately 10.5\u00a0% reduction in overall planned harvesting volume.

Although it increased in the two following years, it remained below the EU average.\nThe second national climate change strategy, adopted by the Hungarian parliament in 2018, places special focus on adaptation to climate change, the development of climate forecasting and protection and the prevention of negative impacts . Further efforts are needed to mainstream the strategy into sectoral policies, continuously enhancing resilience in practice.\nAgriculture is the sector most exposed to the effects of climate change. In agriculture, the greatest losses are caused by droughts, followed by hail and frost damage . Between 1990 and 2023, there were 11\u00a0years in which the proportion of areas affected by drought exceeded 50% of Hungarys territory .

In contrast, higher living standards led to increases in emissions from transport and waste management, while the emission sinks in land use, land use change and forestry decreased. In recent years, the coal phase-out has proceeded, with the closure of all coal mines and the decommissioning of two major coal power plants. As a result, the remaining energy mix in the countrys power and heat generation has become one of the least carbon-intensive in the EU .\nThe policy target set for 2030 is likely to be achieved through the electrification of industry (mostly in the production of iron and steel) and the completion of the coal phase-out in heat generation. This needs to be accompanied by improvements in energy efficiency. Waste management and agriculture will also contribute by reducing methane emissions.

Between 2000 and 2015, Serbia incurred damage amounting to a minimum of EUR\u00a01.8\u00a0billion, but it incurred an additional EUR\u00a05\u00a0billion documented during the subsequent period from 2015 to 2020. In 2021, Serbia suffered a severe drought that caused widespread crop failures. The drought is estimated to have cost the Serbian economy over EUR\u00a0500\u00a0million in lost agricultural output. Finally, during 2022, Serbia experienced a heatwave that caused widespread wildfires. The wildfires caused an estimated EUR\u00a0200\u00a0million in damage, including the loss of over 10\u00a0000\u00a0ha of forest. Given the substantial contribution of agricultural production to the overall gross domestic product, the national economy is notably susceptible to factors influencing agriculture.

It is worth noting that 1990 was the second year of the transformation from a centrally planned to a free market economy. This influenced all sectors, especially heavy industry.

In 20162018, emissions increased, mainly due to economic recovery, the rising number of vehicles and an increase in fuel use. Emissions dropped in 2020 due to COVID-19 and the consequent downturn in fuel consumption and industrial production. After an increase in 2021, due to an economic rebound, there was another drop in 2022, caused by the economic disruption triggered by Russias war of aggression against Ukraine. The main factor was a decrease in fuel use, primarily in electricity and heat production and in households: hard coal consumption decreased by 7% in electricity and heat production and by 16% in households. In 2023, GHG emissions dropped by 8%, mainly due to reductions in the consumption of hard coal (by 14%) and lignite (by 26%) .

Thus, Denmark achieved its interim target of a 5055% reduction by 2025 two years in advance. In 2030, Danish total net emissions are estimated to amount to 22.2\u00a0Mt\u00a0CO 2 eq, corresponding to a reduction of approximately 72% compared with 1990 . Therefore, Denmark is on track to meet the national climate target of a 70% reduction in total emissions by 2030, compared with 1990 levels.\nTo achieve its climate goals, Denmark has introduced a high and uniform carbon dioxide tax on industry . Building on this foundation, the green tripartite agreement agrees to implement the worlds first CO 2 eq tax on agriculture.

In Slovakia, most of the sinks come from forests and forest land.

The main reason is the age structure of the forests, as the ageing forests need to be restructured and close-to-nature management needs to be applied on a substantially higher scale. Forests have been infested by bark beetles and suffered major storm damage, such as in 2004, when a considerable part of the forests in the High Tatras fell during a storm.\n The policy target for 2030 is very unlikely to be achieved. Based on the current modelling results , achieving the goal would require the large-scale application of different measures across all types of land in combination with an approximately 10.5\u00a0% reduction in overall planned harvesting volume.

These targets are GHG emission reductions of 66% in energy, 29% in agriculture and 21% in waste, 95% carbon sink growth for forestry and land use, to balance the expected 45% increase in emissions from industrial processes and other sources .\n- Total GHG emissions and removals in the EU , EEA\nTopics\nClimate change mitigation\nForests and forestry\nLand use Geographical coverage\n- North Macedonia Temporal coverage\n1990-2019\nRelated content\nReferences and footnotes\n- United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Fourth National Communication on Climate Change  National inventory report: Republic of North Macedonia, 2021, accessed 2 July 2025, https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/IV%20Inventory%20report.pdf; National Energy and Climate Plan of the RNM, January 2022, https://www.economy.gov.mk/content/Official%20NECP_EN.pdf .", "blurb": "The indicator shows the trend in total greenhouse gas emissions, excluding those from the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector.

An important part of this progress has been achieved through phasing out fossil fuels in the energy and building sectors, together with improvements in energy efficiency. In contrast, higher living standards led to increases in emissions from transport and waste management, while the emission sinks in land use, land use change and forestry decreased. In recent years, the coal phase-out has proceeded, with the closure of all coal mines and the decommissioning of two major coal power plants. As a result, the remaining energy mix in the countrys power and heat generation has become one of the least carbon-intensive in the EU .\nThe policy target set for 2030 is likely to be achieved through the electrification of industry (mostly in the production of iron and steel) and the completion of the coal phase-out in heat generation. This needs to be accompanied by improvements in energy efficiency. Waste management and agriculture will also contribute by reducing methane emissions.

It is worth noting that 1990 was the second year of the transformation from a centrally planned to a free market economy. This influenced all sectors, especially heavy industry. After a local peak in GHG emissions in 1996 due to an economic rebound, energy efficiency actions were implemented and a slow decrease was observed, with a subsequent stabilisation at the level of about 400\u00a0Mt\u00a0CO 2 eq. This was accompanied by steady economic growth, resulting in emission decoupling. In 2009, GHG emissions decreased, reflecting the worldwide economic slowdown. In 20162018, emissions increased, mainly due to economic recovery, the rising number of vehicles and an increase in fuel use. Emissions dropped in 2020 due to COVID-19 and the consequent downturn in fuel consumption and industrial production. After an increase in 2021, due to an economic rebound, there was another drop in 2022, caused by the economic disruption triggered by Russias war of aggression against Ukraine. The main factor was a decrease in fuel use, primarily in electricity and heat production and in households: hard coal consumption decreased by 7% in electricity and heat production and by 16% in households. In 2023, GHG emissions dropped by 8%, mainly due to reductions in the consumption of hard coal (by 14%) and lignite (by 26%) .

In Slovakia, most of the sinks come from forests and forest land.

The main reason is the age structure of the forests, as the ageing forests need to be restructured and close-to-nature management needs to be applied on a substantially higher scale. Forests have been infested by bark beetles and suffered major storm damage, such as in 2004, when a considerable part of the forests in the High Tatras fell during a storm.\n The policy target for 2030 is very unlikely to be achieved. Based on the current modelling results , achieving the goal would require the large-scale application of different measures across all types of land in combination with an approximately 10.5\u00a0% reduction in overall planned harvesting volume.
