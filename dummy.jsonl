Five mandatory criteria have been defined to select Climate-ADAPT case studies:\n- Clear link to climate change adaptation: the case studies shall describe measures that have been clearly developed as response to climate change challenges, to reduce vulnerability to climate change and/or address its impacts or opportunities, therefore also adopting a long-term perspective.\n- Actual implementation. Case studies shall describe either implemented/under implementation adaptation measures or initiatives that are preparing or enabling the conditions to implement adaptation (e.g. adjustment in governance such as improvement in processes, institutional settings, policies planning, and legislation), tracking both the process and the effectiveness of adaptation across Europe.\n- Accessibility to more detailed information. More detailed information on the case studies shall be easily accessible and re-assessment should be feasible.\n- Geographical scope. The case studies should have the same geographic coverage as \u00a0Climate-ADAPT .\n- Avoiding maladaptation. Initiatives that increase vulnerability of some locations and social groups, that strengthen the causes of climate change, and that create conflict with environmental and sustainability policy goals are not taken into account.\nThe full list of selection criteria for Climate-ADAPT case study is available here .\u00a0More information on this typology of contents is available on the\u00a0case study explorer .\nResearchers and governmental organisations are welcome to\u00a0share information\u00a0on their experiences in terms of case studies.

The process for submitting information varies for the different sections of the platform. External providers can submit information to the platform as described in the\u00a0Share your information\u00a0webpage.\nWhat is the target audience of Climate-ADAPT?\nClimate-ADAPT is designed to assist governmental decision-makers (and organisations providing them support such as agencies, boundary organisations and research institutes) working on the development and implementation of adaptation strategies or actions at EU, transnational, national and sub-national level (e.g. cities).\nWhat is the\u00a0specific\u00a0focus of the Climate-ADAPT database?\nThe Climate-ADAPT database enables users to get an overview of the available knowledge on climate change adaptation in Europe.\u00a0The Climate-ADAPT database provides access to all relevant sources of information by using tailored search criteria and allows a quick overview by screening the metadata available for each information source. The database information is structured in 10 different types of data and is organized in 19 sectors, 7 climate impacts, 9 adaptation elements, different geographic levels and by year.\nCan items with a focus outside climate change adaptation be submitted to the Climate-ADAPT database?\nNo. Database items, news and events with a focus on e.g. climate change mitigation or sustainable management but with no explicit connection with climate change adaptation are outside the scope of the Climate-ADAPT and are therefore not eligible.\nAre exceptions to the defined focus of the Climate-ADAPT possible?\nA notable exception refers to documents on EU policies for which efforts to mainstream adaptation are undertaken. For an explanation of these policies, see the pages on\u00a0EU sector policies .\nFor instance, the Habitats Directive, even if it does not explicitly mention climate change, is very relevant for the mainstreaming of adaptation in biodiversity policies.\nWhat level of scientific detail can be included in documents submitted to the Climate-ADAPT database?\nThe information submitted should be available in a language that is understandable for the intended Climate-ADAPT target audience (see above). Very specialised and technical documents written for technical experts are excluded.\nAre articles published in scientific journals eligible for the Climate-ADAPT database?\nPeer-reviewed scientific articles should not be included in Climate-ADAPT unless they are relevant for the target audience of the platform. In this case, they have to be open access and in English.\nAre items in national languages eligible to the Climate-ADAPT database?\nNo. Since the aim of Climate-ADAPT is to easily share information on adaptation across Europe, items should either be in English or at least include an English summary. This does not include abstracts of scientific articles.\nGEOGRAPHIC SCOPE\nCan items with a geographic context outside the EEA member and cooperating countries be submitted to Climate-ADAPT?\nDatabase items focussing on climate change impacts, vulnerability and/or adaptation beyond the scope of the EU and\u00a0EEA member countries\u00a0are eligible for inclusion in the Climate-ADAPT database only when: i) they are very relevant to Europe (to be explained in the description' field in the metadata sheet); or ii) the source of the information is the European Commission, its contractors or relevant international organisations (such as WHO Europe, ISDR Europe, OECD, IPCC); or iii) they cover Europe as a whole or parts of it.\nWhat does the \"global\" label mean, with reference to the Geographic Information' area in the template for Climate-ADAPT database submissions?\nThe \"global\" label in the Geographic Information' field of the metadata sheet for database items refers either to items that are of a general methodological scope or that have worldwide coverage, in which Europe is included (e.g. IPCC reports).\nCan information that is highly relevant for Europe, but analysed, assessed or implemented elsewhere than in EU or EEA countries, be submitted to Climate-ADAPT?\nGenerally not. A notable exception refers to the Climate-ADAPT database category \"adaptation options\". In this case, please contact the Climate-ADAPT support team via\u00a0climate.adapt@eea.europa.eu\nFILLING OUT THE SUBMISSION TEMPLATE\u00a0FOR DATABASE ITEMS\nWhat should be considered before submitting a new item to the Climate-ADAPT database?\nOnce it is certain that the item is eligible (geographical relevance, focus on climate change vulnerability and/or adaptation), please check if it is already present in the platform by\u00a0searching the database .\nHow can new Climate-ADAPT database items be classified among the different eligible types of information?\nThe\u00a0database type categories\u00a0are self-explanatory and intuitive. If in doubt, please contact the Climate-ADAPT support team via\u00a0climate.adapt@eea.europa.eu\nHow long should the \"description\" of a new Climate-ADAPT database item be?\nTo enhance the user friendliness of the metadata, the description should be limited to about 15 lines and should give only a general idea of the content of the item. Should readers wish to go into more detail, they can access the relevant web link or attachment.\nCan the description or other information be directly copied and pasted from the website and/or the report into the template for the Climate-ADAPT database submission?\nYes, but the focus of the description should be on climate change adaptation and the text must not have revisions in track changes or comments.\nHow to proceed if a field in the Climate-ADAPT database submission template (e.g. \"project title\" or \"report title\") is too short?\nPlease use a shorter version of the text to be inserted.\nWhich information should be inserted in the \"project partners\" field of a \"research and knowledge project\" Climate-ADAPT database submission template?\nPlease insert the full name of all institutions involved in the project.\nHow many sectors/impacts can be selected to characterise a Climate-ADAPT database item?\nOne or more if needed. Please select only non specific if the item is of general (methodological) focus or for cross-cutting items.\nPlease find here a short description for each sector.\nHow should the \"duration\" of a project be inserted into the Climate-ADAPT database submission template?\nIn the format [20XX-20YY]. 20XX and 20YY are the start and end years, respectively.\nHow should the \"source\" of an item be indicated in the Climate-ADAPT database submission template?\nPlease insert the acronym of the institution, website, etc. For documents, do not list the full authorship but the institution responsible for the report.\nWhat is the work-flow of an item from creation to publication?\nYou will receive an automatic e-mail once the item is created, in this phase you will still be allowed to make changes.", "blurb": "Skip to main content Skip to navigation Skip to footer\nAn official website of the European Union | How do you know?\nAll official European Union website addresses are in the europa.eu domain.", "semantic_identifier": "FAQ for providers", "source_type": "web", "metadata": {}, "updated_at": null, "link": "https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/help/faq-providers/index_html", "source_links": {"0": "https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/help/faq-providers/index_html"}, "match_highlights": ["", ") working on the development and implementation of adaptation strategies or actions at EU, transnational, national and sub-national level (e.g. cities).\nWhat is the\u00a0specific\u00a0focus of the <hi>Climate</hi>-<hi>ADAPT</hi> <hi>database</hi>?\nThe <hi>Climate</hi>-<hi>ADAPT</hi> <hi>database</hi> enables users to get an overview of the available knowledge on <hi>climate</hi> change adaptation in..."]}, {"document_id": "https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/observatory/policy-context/country-profiles/romania", "content": "Skip to main content Skip to navigation Skip to footer\nAn official website of the European Union | How do you know?\nAll official European Union website addresses are in the europa.eu domain.

The process for submitting information varies for the different sections of the platform. External providers can submit information to the platform as described in the\u00a0Share your information\u00a0webpage.\nWhat is the target audience of Climate-ADAPT?\nClimate-ADAPT is designed to assist governmental decision-makers (and organisations providing them support such as agencies, boundary organisations and research institutes) working on the development and implementation of adaptation strategies or actions at EU, transnational, national and sub-national level (e.g. cities).\nWhat is the\u00a0specific\u00a0focus of the Climate-ADAPT database?\nThe Climate-ADAPT database enables users to get an overview of the available knowledge on climate change adaptation in Europe.\u00a0The Climate-ADAPT database provides access to all relevant sources of information by using tailored search criteria and allows a quick overview by screening the metadata available for each information source. The database information is structured in 10 different types of data and is organized in 19 sectors, 7 climate impacts, 9 adaptation elements, different geographic levels and by year.\nCan items with a focus outside climate change adaptation be submitted to the Climate-ADAPT database?\nNo. Database items, news and events with a focus on e.g. climate change mitigation or sustainable management but with no explicit connection with climate change adaptation are outside the scope of the Climate-ADAPT and are therefore not eligible.\nAre exceptions to the defined focus of the Climate-ADAPT possible?\nA notable exception refers to documents on EU policies for which efforts to mainstream adaptation are undertaken. For an explanation of these policies, see the pages on\u00a0EU sector policies .\nFor instance, the Habitats Directive, even if it does not explicitly mention climate change, is very relevant for the mainstreaming of adaptation in biodiversity policies.\nWhat level of scientific detail can be included in documents submitted to the Climate-ADAPT database?\nThe information submitted should be available in a language that is understandable for the intended Climate-ADAPT target audience (see above). Very specialised and technical documents written for technical experts are excluded.\nAre articles published in scientific journals eligible for the Climate-ADAPT database?\nPeer-reviewed scientific articles should not be included in Climate-ADAPT unless they are relevant for the target audience of the platform. In this case, they have to be open access and in English.\nAre items in national languages eligible to the Climate-ADAPT database?\nNo. Since the aim of Climate-ADAPT is to easily share information on adaptation across Europe, items should either be in English or at least include an English summary. This does not include abstracts of scientific articles.\nGEOGRAPHIC SCOPE\nCan items with a geographic context outside the EEA member and cooperating countries be submitted to Climate-ADAPT?\nDatabase items focussing on climate change impacts, vulnerability and/or adaptation beyond the scope of the EU and\u00a0EEA member countries\u00a0are eligible for inclusion in the Climate-ADAPT database only when: i) they are very relevant to Europe (to be explained in the description' field in the metadata sheet); or ii) the source of the information is the European Commission, its contractors or relevant international organisations (such as WHO Europe, ISDR Europe, OECD, IPCC); or iii) they cover Europe as a whole or parts of it.\nWhat does the \"global\" label mean, with reference to the Geographic Information' area in the template for Climate-ADAPT database submissions?\nThe \"global\" label in the Geographic Information' field of the metadata sheet for database items refers either to items that are of a general methodological scope or that have worldwide coverage, in which Europe is included (e.g. IPCC reports).\nCan information that is highly relevant for Europe, but analysed, assessed or implemented elsewhere than in EU or EEA countries, be submitted to Climate-ADAPT?\nGenerally not. A notable exception refers to the Climate-ADAPT database category \"adaptation options\". In this case, please contact the Climate-ADAPT support team via\u00a0climate.adapt@eea.europa.eu\nFILLING OUT THE SUBMISSION TEMPLATE\u00a0FOR DATABASE ITEMS\nWhat should be considered before submitting a new item to the Climate-ADAPT database?", "blurb": "Skip to main content Skip to navigation Skip to footer\nAn official website of the European Union | How do you know?\nAll official European Union website addresses are in the europa.eu domain.", "semantic_identifier": "FAQ for providers", "source_type": "web", "metadata": {}, "updated_at": null, "link": "https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/help/faq-providers/index_html", "source_links": {"0": "https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/help/faq-providers/index_html"}, "match_highlights": ["", "cities).\nWhat is the\u00a0specific\u00a0focus of the <hi>Climate</hi>-<hi>ADAPT</hi> <hi>database</hi>?\nThe <hi>Climate</hi>-<hi>ADAPT</hi> <hi>database</hi> enables users to get an overview of the available knowledge on <hi>climate</hi> <hi>change</hi> <hi>adaptation</hi> in Europe.\u00a0The <hi>Climate</hi>-<hi>ADAPT</hi> <hi>database</hi> provides access to all relevant sources of information by using..."]}, {"document_id": "https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/knowledge/tools/adaptation-support-tool/step-0-2", "content": "They shall focus, in particular, on the most vulnerable and impacted populations and sectors, and identify shortcomings in this regard in consultation with civil society.\n- Member States shall adopt and implement national adaptation strategies and plans, taking into consideration the Union strategy on adaptation to climate change and based on robust climate change and vulnerability analyses, progress assessments and indicators, and guided by the best available and most recent scientific evidence.

Member States shall regularly update the strategies and include the related updated information in the reports to be submitted to the Commission.\nDue to the varying severity and nature of climate impacts between regions in Europe, most adaptation initiatives will be taken at the regional or local levels.

Adaptation is therefore crucial to deal with the current climate variability and unavoidable impacts of climate change as well as \u00a0with specific vulnerabilities in terms of age, health, place of residence, socio-economic status and other aspects. The concept of leaving no one behind in climate change also called justice in adaptation or just resilience, thus needs to be properly taken into account in implementing just, transformative and long-term climate adaptation policies and measures to avoid maladaptive practices, redistributing risk or reinforcing existing inequalities, and avoid creating winners and losers.

The Strategy outlines a long-term vision for the EU to become a climate-resilient society, fully adapted to the unavoidable impacts of climate change by 2050. This strategy aims to reinforce the adaptive capacity of the EU and the world and minimise vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, in line with the Paris Agreement and the European Climate Law\u00a0which writes into law the goal set out in the European Green Deal.

The Strategy outlines a long-term vision for the EU to become a climate-resilient society, fully adapted to the unavoidable impacts of climate change by 2050. This strategy aims to reinforce the adaptive capacity of the EU and the world and minimise vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, in line with the Paris Agreement and the European Climate Law\u00a0which writes into law the goal set out in the European Green Deal. The law recognises adaptation as a key component of the long-term global response to climate change and requires Member States and the Union to enhance their adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change.

The briefing shows that highlighting examples of adaptation actions can boost learning across the EU, Member States as well as regional and local authorities to help societies better prepare for climate change\u00a0\nNine criteria have been defined for selecting and presenting Climate-ADAPT case studies.\nCase studies serve as inspiration on how known adaptation options can be implemented in practice under a range of different conditions.\u00a0\nThis collection is regularly updated with new case studies, aiming to reach a balanced distribution of represented sectors, climate-related impacts, approaches applied and geographic locations. Case studies included are also periodically reassessed and updated, to track both the process and the effectiveness of adaptation actions across Europe.\u00a0\u00a0\nAccess to Climate-ADAPT Case studies\nTo learn from diverse experiences, explore Climate-ADAPT case studies through the map-basedCase study explorer below. Case studies can be explored through the following three filters:\nAdaptation Sectors  Users can navigate across 19 adaptation sectors addressed by the case studies in terms of climate change adaptation.\nClimate Impacts  This filter enables users to filter case studies through climate change impacts they cope with.\nKey Type Measures - This filter enables users to select case studies through the categories of adaptation options implemented. The adaptation options are labelled by Key Type Measures (KTM).\u00a0 The KTM are a common framework and reporting approach for climate change adaptation that allows clustering the wider variety of adaptation options and measures across EEA Member countries.\nAdaptation approaches - This filter allows to select case studies with explicit descriptions of how adaptation approaches were applied in the case studies which are key for leaning on the effectiveness of adaptation actions and governance settings. Examplese are the availability of monitoring, learning and evaluation (MLE), the consideration of environmental, economic and social co-benefits and trade-offs, and the replication and/or upscaling potential of adaptation actions described in the case studies.\nAdaptation sectors\nClimate impacts\nKey type measures\nAdaptation approaches\nClimate-ADAPT case studies\nYou can also access case studies through theClimate-ADAPT resource catalogue. The catalogue enables filtering case studies by adaptation sectors they address, climate impacts  they cope with, adaptation elements they apply and by countries and transnational regions where they are located.\nHow to share case studies on Climate-ADAPT\n\t\tCase studies are developed by the European Environment Agency (EEA), with the support of the European Topic Centre on Climate Change Adaptation and LULUCF ( ETC CA , former ETC/CCA) and with key collaboration of the organisations responsible for their implementation. Climate-ADAPT stakeholders are welcome to share information about their own experiences that meet case study criteria by contacting climate.adapt@eea.europa.eu . Find case study catalogues of EEA Member countries Climate-ADAPT case studies complement case study catalogues, prepared at national levels by EEA Member countries.

Member States shall regularly update the strategies and include the related updated information in the reports to be submitted to the Commission.\nDue to the varying severity and nature of climate impacts between regions in Europe, most adaptation initiatives will be taken at the regional or local levels. The ability to cope and adapt differs across populations, economic sectors, and regions within Europe. Adaptation is therefore crucial to deal with the current climate variability and unavoidable impacts of climate change as well as \u00a0with specific vulnerabilities in terms of age, health, place of residence, socio-economic status and other aspects. The concept of leaving no one behind in climate change also called justice in adaptation or just resilience, thus needs to be properly taken into account in implementing just, transformative and long-term climate adaptation policies and measures to avoid maladaptive practices, redistributing risk or reinforcing existing inequalities, and avoid creating winners and losers. It will also help to take advantage of any opportunities that .\nThe ETC/CCA Technical Paper 2/2021 'Just transition in the context of adaptation to climate change' provides an overview of knowledge and practice for just resilience in Europe as a scoping exercise based on a rapid review of various knowledge resources, such as scientific literature on social impacts of adaptation and resilience, information from Eionet contacts on climate change adaptation in EEA Member countries, input from the Expert Group on Just Resilience, established for this analysis, information from regulatory reports on national adaptation progress and a screening of the Climate-ADAPT database.

The process for submitting information varies for the different sections of the platform. External providers can submit information to the platform as described in the\u00a0Share your information\u00a0webpage.\nWhat is the target audience of Climate-ADAPT?\nClimate-ADAPT is designed to assist governmental decision-makers (and organisations providing them support such as agencies, boundary organisations and research institutes) working on the development and implementation of adaptation strategies or actions at EU, transnational, national and sub-national level (e.g. cities).\nWhat is the\u00a0specific\u00a0focus of the Climate-ADAPT database?\nThe Climate-ADAPT database enables users to get an overview of the available knowledge on climate change adaptation in Europe.\u00a0The Climate-ADAPT database provides access to all relevant sources of information by using tailored search criteria and allows a quick overview by screening the metadata available for each information source. The database information is structured in 10 different types of data and is organized in 19 sectors, 7 climate impacts, 9 adaptation elements, different geographic levels and by year.\nCan items with a focus outside climate change adaptation be submitted to the Climate-ADAPT database?\nNo. Database items, news and events with a focus on e.g. climate change mitigation or sustainable management but with no explicit connection with climate change adaptation are outside the scope of the Climate-ADAPT and are therefore not eligible.\nAre exceptions to the defined focus of the Climate-ADAPT possible?\nA notable exception refers to documents on EU policies for which efforts to mainstream adaptation are undertaken. For an explanation of these policies, see the pages on\u00a0EU sector policies .\nFor instance, the Habitats Directive, even if it does not explicitly mention climate change, is very relevant for the mainstreaming of adaptation in biodiversity policies.\nWhat level of scientific detail can be included in documents submitted to the Climate-ADAPT database?\nThe information submitted should be available in a language that is understandable for the intended Climate-ADAPT target audience (see above). Very specialised and technical documents written for technical experts are excluded.\nAre articles published in scientific journals eligible for the Climate-ADAPT database?\nPeer-reviewed scientific articles should not be included in Climate-ADAPT unless they are relevant for the target audience of the platform. In this case, they have to be open access and in English.\nAre items in national languages eligible to the Climate-ADAPT database?\nNo. Since the aim of Climate-ADAPT is to easily share information on adaptation across Europe, items should either be in English or at least include an English summary. This does not include abstracts of scientific articles.\nGEOGRAPHIC SCOPE\nCan items with a geographic context outside the EEA member and cooperating countries be submitted to Climate-ADAPT?\nDatabase items focussing on climate change impacts, vulnerability and/or adaptation beyond the scope of the EU and\u00a0EEA member countries\u00a0are eligible for inclusion in the Climate-ADAPT database only when: i) they are very relevant to Europe (to be explained in the description' field in the metadata sheet); or ii) the source of the information is the European Commission, its contractors or relevant international organisations (such as WHO Europe, ISDR Europe, OECD, IPCC); or iii) they cover Europe as a whole or parts of it.\nWhat does the \"global\" label mean, with reference to the Geographic Information' area in the template for Climate-ADAPT database submissions?\nThe \"global\" label in the Geographic Information' field of the metadata sheet for database items refers either to items that are of a general methodological scope or that have worldwide coverage, in which Europe is included (e.g. IPCC reports).\nCan information that is highly relevant for Europe, but analysed, assessed or implemented elsewhere than in EU or EEA countries, be submitted to Climate-ADAPT?\nGenerally not. A notable exception refers to the Climate-ADAPT database category \"adaptation options\". In this case, please contact the Climate-ADAPT support team via\u00a0climate.adapt@eea.europa.eu\nFILLING OUT THE SUBMISSION TEMPLATE\u00a0FOR DATABASE ITEMS\nWhat should be considered before submitting a new item to the Climate-ADAPT database?\nOnce it is certain that the item is eligible (geographical relevance, focus on climate change vulnerability and/or adaptation), please check if it is already present in the platform by\u00a0searching the database .\nHow can new Climate-ADAPT database items be classified among the different eligible types of information?\nThe\u00a0database type categories\u00a0are self-explanatory and intuitive. If in doubt, please contact the Climate-ADAPT support team via\u00a0climate.adapt@eea.europa.eu\nHow long should the \"description\" of a new Climate-ADAPT database item be?\nTo enhance the user friendliness of the metadata, the description should be limited to about 15 lines and should give only a general idea of the content of the item. Should readers wish to go into more detail, they can access the relevant web link or attachment.\nCan the description or other information be directly copied and pasted from the website and/or the report into the template for the Climate-ADAPT database submission?\nYes, but the focus of the description should be on climate change adaptation and the text must not have revisions in track changes or comments.\nHow to proceed if a field in the Climate-ADAPT database submission template (e.g. \"project title\" or \"report title\") is too short?\nPlease use a shorter version of the text to be inserted.\nWhich information should be inserted in the \"project partners\" field of a \"research and knowledge project\" Climate-ADAPT database submission template?\nPlease insert the full name of all institutions involved in the project.\nHow many sectors/impacts can be selected to characterise a Climate-ADAPT database item?\nOne or more if needed. Please select only non specific if the item is of general (methodological) focus or for cross-cutting items.\nPlease find here a short description for each sector.\nHow should the \"duration\" of a project be inserted into the Climate-ADAPT database submission template?\nIn the format [20XX-20YY]. 20XX and 20YY are the start and end years, respectively.\nHow should the \"source\" of an item be indicated in the Climate-ADAPT database submission template?\nPlease insert the acronym of the institution, website, etc. For documents, do not list the full authorship but the institution responsible for the report.\nWhat is the work-flow of an item from creation to publication?\nYou will receive an automatic e-mail once the item is created, in this phase you will still be allowed to make changes.", "blurb": "Skip to main content Skip to navigation Skip to footer\nAn official website of the European Union | How do you know?\nAll official European Union website addresses are in the europa.eu domain.", "semantic_identifier": "FAQ for providers", "source_type": "web", "metadata": {}, "updated_at": null, "link": "https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/help/faq-providers/index_html", "source_links": {"0": "https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/help/faq-providers/index_html"}, "match_highlights": ["", ") working on the development and implementation of adaptation strategies or actions at EU, transnational, national and sub-national level (e.g. cities).\nWhat is the\u00a0specific\u00a0focus of the <hi>Climate</hi>-<hi>ADAPT</hi> <hi>database</hi>?\nThe <hi>Climate</hi>-<hi>ADAPT</hi> <hi>database</hi> enables users to get an overview of the available knowledge on <hi>climate</hi> change adaptation in..."]}, {"document_id": "https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/help/share-your-info/case-studies", "content": "Skip to main content Skip to navigation Skip to footer\nAn official website of the European Union | How do you know?\nAll official European Union website addresses are in the europa.eu domain.

Landslide risk zones have been identified across Europe in the European Landslide Susceptibility Map ( ELSUS v2 ). The EU-funded GIMS project developed an advanced, low-cost system for monitoring landslides and subsidence, which can detect when hillslopes are primed for sliding and provide early indications of rapid, catastrophic movement. Norway and Italy have national EWSs for landslides, while in Italy, several regional governments also operate EWSs (Guzzetti et al., 2020).\nImmediate actions after a landslide, such as issuing early warnings and activating search and rescue services and first aid for the injured (often part of existing disaster plans) can significantly reduce the health impacts of landslides. Government support after forced displacement due to events like landslides can also reduce long-term mental health impacts (Baseler and Hennig, 2023).\nAt the EU level, no specific policies respond exclusively to landslides.

Mititelu, WWF\nThe Lower Danube Green Corridor Agreement, initiated in 2000 by Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, and Moldova, focuses on restoring wetlands, reconnecting the river to natural floodplains, and improving local economies. Positive outcomes include enhanced flood resilience, biodiversity, and economic diversification.\nIn 2000, the governments of Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Moldova pledged to work together  with the signing of the Lower Danube Green Corridor Agreement - to establish a green corridor along the entire length of the Lower Danube River (~1,000 km). All partners recognized a need and shared responsibility to protect and manage the Lower Danube in a sustainable way. The Lower Danube Green Corridor Agreement aimed to protect and restore wetlands along the river and reconnect the river to its natural flooding areas, reducing the risks of major flooding in areas with human settlements and offering benefits both for local economies  e.g. through fisheries, tourism  and for the ecosystems along the river. The current outcomes of the initiative show that the restoration projects have provided many benefits, including improved natural capacity to retain and release floodwaters, enhanced biodiversity, and strengthened local economies through diversification of livelihoods based on natural resources. The implemented measures are expected to increase resilience of natural systems and local societies in managing current climate variability and the likely impacts of further climate change.\nCase Study Description\nChallenges\nObjectives of the adaptation measure\nAdaptation Options Implemented In This Case\nSolutions\nImportance and Relevance of Adaptation\nAdditional Details\nStakeholder participation\nSuccess and limiting factors\nCosts and benefits\nLegal aspects\nImplementation time\nLifetime\nReference Information\nContact\nWebsites\nSource\nCase Study Description\nChallenges\nAgriculture, forestry and transport have taken their toll on the naturalness of the Lower Danube.\n\n...\n\nIn Romania, 6,000 hectares of floodplains on the islands of Babina and Cernovca, Mahmudia, Balta Geraiului, G\u00e2rla Mare - Vrata have been or are being reconnected to the river, creating a mosaic of habitats. As natural processes have been re-established, numerous bird species have come back and fish populations have increased. On Tataru Island in Ukraine, traditional cattle breeds were brought in to control invasive species. Dikes were removed to allow 750 hectares of land to flood naturally, providing rich feeding, breeding and spawning grounds for wildlife. As of today, some restoration projects are still ongoing, such as the G\u00e2rla Mare and Vrata ones that will have an impact on an area of 2000 ha.\nDecommissioning under-performing flood protection dikes and restoring floodplains is contributing to safer and more effective floodwater retention, more robust and dependable freshwater ecosystem services, lower infrastructure maintenance costs and strengthened local economies through diversification of livelihoods based on natural resources. During the 2013 flood in the Danube, along the Lower Danube there was no flooding, although water was above the average level.\nRelevance\nCase mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of climate change adaptation aspects.\nAdditional Details\nStakeholder participation\nWWF has taken responsibility for the Lower Danube Green Corridor initiative as part of the WWF Living Planet Programme which is aimed to secure the conservation of important biological resources and ecosystems into the next millennium. In the Lower Danube Green Corridor project, WWF works closely with the governments of the countries - Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova and Ukraine - that signed the Agreement, as well as local stakeholders. To achieve the objectives, each country prepared an action plan in which additional areas of floodplain were designated for protection and restoration. These action plans described for each designated area what specific measures were needed and what steps had to be taken to carry out these measures.\nInvolved stakeholders supported a regular exchange of information - through meetings and by establishing contact points at the Ministries of Environment in the four participating countries - in order to achieve effective protection of the Lower Danube Green Corridor. WWF played a facilitator role to increase communication and cooperation between the Lower Danube Green Corridor countries. It also supported the implementation of concrete restoration projects, like models to be scaled up.\nBoth citizens and environmental NGOs were offered the opportunity to play an active role in decision making processes. WWF has conducted awareness raising campaigns and also directly engaged the general public and NGOs in the decision making process in the project area.\nActive lobbying has been done at national and international levels to boost the implementation of the Lower Danube Green Corridor.\nFurthermore, partners were sought locally and nationally as well as internationally, i.e. GEF, UNDP, UNEP, World Bank, EU, WWF, IUCN, Ramsar Convention and other Governments (i.e. Austria, Germany, Denmark, Netherlands), to solicit their co-operation and assistance in the creation and maintenance of a Lower Danube Green Corridor. The main funding came from WWF, national governments, EU and the business sector.\nNowadays, due to political changes, the main challenge for WWFs activities is to furthermore convince the authorities about the multi-beneficial effects of nature-based solutions, such as floodplain and wetland restoration to increase climate change resilience.\nSuccess and limiting factors\nInternational agreements for better water and river management have been a powerful tool for change in the Danube River Basin. Restoring the natural resilience of the environment to climate events (in this case large-scale adaptation) by decommissioning under-performing water infrastructure and thereby improving the natural capacity to retain and release peak floods, brings additional benefits both for nature and people. New opportunities for eco-tourism, fishing, grazing and fibre production strengthen local economies. The resulting higher quality of habitats attracts a wider range of species, including endangered ones.\nThe Lower Danube Green Corridor Agreement served as an excellent basis to translate governmental decisions into actions. In countries like Romania and Bulgaria, the implementation of the Natura 2000 network significantly contributed to increasing the area under protection. Also, the harmonisation of the environmental legislation with the EU requirements, especially the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, opened new opportunities to restore lateral connectivity. In other cases, the need of the local communities to have access to enhanced natural resources was the main driver.\nProper attention to the issue of land ownership was the key to success in the project. In each restoration project a few to a dozen landowners - depending on the size of the restoration area - had to be convinced that a change in land use would be beneficial for them. In the case of private landowners, it was important to assure that they do not lose the property rights. WWF started two pilot projects in Romania, where local communities and individuals gave their land to be flooded. The trigger to accept such rigorous change in land use was the understanding of the benefits deriving from changing the unproductive arable land into wetlands.\n\n...\n\nReference Information\nContact\nOrieta Hulea\nConservation Director WWF International\nDanube-Carpathian Programme\nE-mail: ohulea@wwfdcp.ro\u00a0\nCamelia Ionescu\nFreshwater Project Manager\nWWF Romania\nE-mail: cionescu@wwf.ro\u00a0\nIulia Puiu\nProject Manager for Wetland Restoration Projects\nWWF Romania\nE-mail: ipuiu@wwf.ro\u00a0\nWebsites\nhttp://danube.panda.org/wwf/web/search/details.jsp?pid=41\nhttps://wwfeu.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/lessons_learnt_fromthe_lower_danube_landscape.pdf\nhttp://iopscience.iop.org/1755-1315/6/40/402002\nReferences\nWWF International Danube-Carpathian Programme\nPublished in Climate-ADAPT : Jun 7, 2016\nPlease contact us for any other enquiry on this Case Study or to share a new Case Study (email climate.adapt@eea.europa.eu )\nShare your information\nCase Study illustrations ( 6 )\nDate of creation:\n2020 Keywords: Biodiversity enhancement, Danube, ecosystem services, flood management, floodplain restoration, green corridor Climate impacts:\nFlooding Adaptation Approaches:\nEconomic aspects, Environmental aspects, Adaptation Measures and Actions, Nature-based solutions, Adaptation Plans and Strategies, Societal aspects Sectors:\nBiodiversity, Disaster Risk Reduction, Forestry, Water management Governance level: Transnational region (stretching across country borders) Geographic characterisation:\nEurope Macro-Transnational region:\nDanube Area, Black Sea Basin (NEXT), Mediterranean (Euro-Med) Biogeographical regions:\nContinental Countries:\nBulgaria, Romania\nHealth impact:\n-NONSPECIFIC-\nCase Studies Documents ( 1 )\nWWF Fact Sheet 2015\nLanguage preference detected\nDo you want to see the page translated into ?

Many countries across Europe reported that they are conducting national, local, and sector specific CCRVAs, including examining specific risks and vulnerabilities to public health and the health sector.\nMore than one third of countries reported a high level of observed impacts from climate change, including changes to the frequency and magnitude of events, a high likelihood of exposure to future climate related hazards, and high levels of vulnerability. The majority of countries also reported that their health sector is at medium or high risk of future climate change impacts. Croatia , Hungary , Latvia , Portugal , and Slovakia reported high levels of concern across all four categories. Some of the key climate related health hazards identified by CCRVA include outbreaks of infectious disease, heat stress, drought, flooding, and the spread of allergens.\nCountry reporting of climate change impacts on the health sector.\nSource: Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action 2023 Reporting\nVulnerable populations are disproportionately affected by climate-related health hazards.\nCCRVAs have also been used to identify how various demographic groups will be impacted differently by climate related health hazards. Across Europe, there is increasing recognition that the impacts of climate change will not be felt equally. Vulnerable populations, including older adults, children, people living with disabilities, medical pre-conditions, or in poverty will experience the impacts of climate change differently than members of society that live without health challenges and have access to the tools and resources required to adapt to climate related impacts. Vulnerable populations are often more exposed to climate change impacts and may lack the necessary resources to adequately respond to or mitigate climate-related risks.\nThis approach enables policy makers to develop targeted strategies to protect vulnerable populations from climate related hazards and public health risks. Some of the key actions taken to protect populations from climate driven health risks include the implementation of surveillance and early warning systems, community outreach and sensitization towards climate related hazards, improved public infrastructure, including blue-green infrastructure to address urban flood and heat risks, public water fountains, and the introduction of cooling centers.\nCountries across Europe are taking proactive steps to address climate change impacts on the health sector.\nEuropean countries are planning and implementing adaptation measures that take into consideration the impacts of climate change on human health.\nThe countries, for example Croatia , Cyprus , Czechia , Denmark , Germany or Portugal , report on cooperation through working groups, commissions and other governance structures bringing public authorities and other stakeholders working on health and climate change together and aiming at greater policy integration.\nIn countries such as Ireland , Finland, and Sweden , sectoral health adaptation plans have been developed. Moreover, in Austria and Bulgaria , climate-related topics have been integrated into the curriculum and continuing education of medical care providers, including doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals. The goal of this is to enhance the ability of healthcare professionals to respond to and treat climate related health impacts as well as respond to new and emerging climate related health challenges.\nMany countries, including Austria , Bulgaria , Cyprus , Germany and Poland have implemented programs to enhance public awareness of climate change related health impacts, including how to improve personal preparedness at home. Several countries have also implemented monitoring and early warning systems to alert the public, employers, as well as the health sector of potential climate change related impacts and emergencies. Early warning systems are designed to alert authorities of flood risk, extreme temperatures, allergens, or the presents of pathogens or infectious diseases to enable time for a proactive response. In some jurisdictions, early warning systems inform when to open cooling centres, evacuate people living in flood zones, or close recreational bathing spots due to the presence of bacteria. \u00a0\u00a0\nCountry reporting includes examples of actions taken to address various climate risks to health in residential, workplace and healthcare settings\nThe most frequently listed examples of actions are focused on managing the health risks from high temperatures and monitoring the infectious (particularly vector-borne) diseases, followed by addressing flood-related health issues.\nIn Germany , integration of climate change risks to health is ongoing in occupational health and safety provisions.\u00a0 In Finland , provisions on factors relating to residential building temperature conditions that are affected by the changing climate are laid on.

Non-EU EEA member countries were invited to provide similar information on a voluntary basis. This webpage presents the key health aspects of the adaptation information reported. Extracts on health from the individual countries reporting are available through climate and health country profiles .\u00a0\u00a0\nKey messages\n- In 2023, health was reported as the sector most affected by climate change impacts.\u00a0\n- Most of the Climate Change Risk and Vulnerability Assessments report a high risk of potential future impacts within the health sector.\u00a0\u00a0\n- Vulnerable populations are recognised as disproportionately affected by climate-related health hazards.\u00a0\u00a0\n- The proactive steps taken to address climate change impacts on the health sector by the countries include setting up collaborative governance structure, training and education programmes for the healthcare workers, awareness-raising and implementation of early warning systems.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn 2023, health was reported as the sector most affected by climate change impacts\u00a0\u00a0\nAs part of the 2023 country reporting, European countries reported that health was the sector most affected by climate change impacts. At the same time, European national and regional strategies, plans, and frameworks, point to health as a priority sector for climate change adaptation. This signals widespread recognition among European countries of the impacts of climate change on human health and the urgent need to prepare the healthcare sector to better respond to climate change impacts.\u00a0\nKey affected sectors reported in 2023. Source: EEA, 2023\nMost countries reported a high risk of potential future impacts.\nThe primary approach to identifying climate change impacts across Europe is through a Climate Change Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (CCRVA), which integrates data on climate hazards, vulnerable sectors, infrastructure, and demographics to identify the level of risk posed by climate change related hazards. Many countries across Europe reported that they are conducting national, local, and sector specific CCRVAs, including examining specific risks and vulnerabilities to public health and the health sector.\nMore than one third of countries reported a high level of observed impacts from climate change, including changes to the frequency and magnitude of events, a high likelihood of exposure to future climate related hazards, and high levels of vulnerability. The majority of countries also reported that their health sector is at medium or high risk of future climate change impacts. Croatia , Hungary , Latvia , Portugal , and Slovakia reported high levels of concern across all four categories. Some of the key climate related health hazards identified by CCRVA include outbreaks of infectious disease, heat stress, drought, flooding, and the spread of allergens.\nCountry reporting of climate change impacts on the health sector.\nSource: Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action 2023 Reporting\nVulnerable populations are disproportionately affected by climate-related health hazards.\nCCRVAs have also been used to identify how various demographic groups will be impacted differently by climate related health hazards. Across Europe, there is increasing recognition that the impacts of climate change will not be felt equally. Vulnerable populations, including older adults, children, people living with disabilities, medical pre-conditions, or in poverty will experience the impacts of climate change differently than members of society that live without health challenges and have access to the tools and resources required to adapt to climate related impacts. Vulnerable populations are often more exposed to climate change impacts and may lack the necessary resources to adequately respond to or mitigate climate-related risks.\nThis approach enables policy makers to develop targeted strategies to protect vulnerable populations from climate related hazards and public health risks. Some of the key actions taken to protect populations from climate driven health risks include the implementation of surveillance and early warning systems, community outreach and sensitization towards climate related hazards, improved public infrastructure, including blue-green infrastructure to address urban flood and heat risks, public water fountains, and the introduction of cooling centers.\nCountries across Europe are taking proactive steps to address climate change impacts on the health sector.\nEuropean countries are planning and implementing adaptation measures that take into consideration the impacts of climate change on human health.\nThe countries, for example Croatia , Cyprus , Czechia , Denmark , Germany or Portugal , report on cooperation through working groups, commissions and other governance structures bringing public authorities and other stakeholders working on health and climate change together and aiming at greater policy integration.\nIn countries such as Ireland , Finland, and Sweden , sectoral health adaptation plans have been developed. Moreover, in Austria and Bulgaria , climate-related topics have been integrated into the curriculum and continuing education of medical care providers, including doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals. The goal of this is to enhance the ability of healthcare professionals to respond to and treat climate related health impacts as well as respond to new and emerging climate related health challenges.\nMany countries, including Austria , Bulgaria , Cyprus , Germany and Poland have implemented programs to enhance public awareness of climate change related health impacts, including how to improve personal preparedness at home. Several countries have also implemented monitoring and early warning systems to alert the public, employers, as well as the health sector of potential climate change related impacts and emergencies. Early warning systems are designed to alert authorities of flood risk, extreme temperatures, allergens, or the presents of pathogens or infectious diseases to enable time for a proactive response. In some jurisdictions, early warning systems inform when to open cooling centres, evacuate people living in flood zones, or close recreational bathing spots due to the presence of bacteria. \u00a0\u00a0\nCountry reporting includes examples of actions taken to address various climate risks to health in residential, workplace and healthcare settings\nThe most frequently listed examples of actions are focused on managing the health risks from high temperatures and monitoring the infectious (particularly vector-borne) diseases, followed by addressing flood-related health issues.\nIn Germany , integration of climate change risks to health is ongoing in occupational health and safety provisions.\u00a0 In Finland , provisions on factors relating to residential building temperature conditions that are affected by the changing climate are laid on. In Austria , Guideline Heat Action Plan supports medical and care facilities in developing and establishing their own heat plans.\nThe countries include examples of adaptation plans with focus on health at the sub-national level, for example in Italy , Poland , Portugal , or Romania .\nFurther information\nMore information is available through climate and health country profile .\nLanguage preference detected\nDo you want to see the page translated into ?

One of the NAPs five strategic goals to address climate change risks is: Human life, health and wellbeing are protected from the adverse effects of climate change. This goal includes measures like improvement of early warning system (especially on weather extremes), access to free drinking water in public places, awareness rising among educational and social care institutions, development of recommendations for social care institutions and social workers on health prevention measures during heat waves, etc.\nHealth is one of the sectors included in the system for monitoring adaptation to climate change on a national scale designed by the Latvian Environment, Geology and Meteorology Centre.\nSuch a monitoring system is essential for further development of national political strategies, since it consists of data and indicators that measure vulnerability of different economic sectors due to climate change.\nMinistry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development, in cooperation with BaltConsults, Estonian. Latvian & Lithuanian Environment, Process Analysis and Research Centre, LVMI Silava and the Green Liberty Society have developed studies on risk and vulnerability assessment and identification of adaptation measures in six areas including health and wellbeing.\nInformation from EEA report.

The Ministry of Health is among the ministries responsible for implementation of the NAP.\nThe overall climate change adaptation priority of Latvia is to reduce the vulnerability of people, economy, infrastructure, construction and environment to the impacts of climate change. To meet this aim, the NAP has more than 80 concrete adaptation measures and 5 Strategic goals to address climate change risks. Disaster risk management and civil protection is one of the five strategic goals of NAP: 'Human life, health and well-being, regardless of gender, age and social background, are protected from the adverse effects of climate change'. To achieve the goal there are planned measures to address both  human health and well-being, and civil protection, such as improvement of early warning system (especially on weather extremes), access to free drinking water in public places, awareness rising among educational and social care institutions, development of recommendations for social care institutions and social workers on health prevention measures during heat waves etc.\nAssessments on primary and secondary impacts of climate change, risks and vulnerability have been carried out, which also included cost-benefit analysis for adaptation measures, indicators and draft for the monitoring system.

Health is the focus of the Regional Strategies of Adaptation to Climate Change - Health Region of Lisboa e Vale do Tejo (SAP, 2019). The implementation of health sector strategies is based on the networking of health services with other security, environmental and/or social support entities.\nThe health department is a part of in the Climate Action Commission, created in 2015 to enhance the involvement and promote the accountability of the various sectors for greater integration of climate policy in sectoral policies. Responsibilities of the Commission include: a) Providing political guidelines in the context of climate change; b) Promoting the articulation and integration of climate change policies in sectoral policies; c) Monitoring the implementation of sectoral measures, programmes, and actions.\nThe impact of climate action is identified in terms of health, amongst other fields, within an evaluation tool (Model of the Pilot Project on Prior Evaluation of Legislative Impact on Climate Action) developed to measure climate impacts of legislative proposals and sectoral policies. The pilot project is being implemented regarding preliminary legislative impact assessment on climate action, promoting alignment with the objectives undertaken by Portugal in terms of climate policy and providing an enhanced legislative procedure and a more transparent legal system.\nIn the health sector, it is essential to monitor the state health of the population, considering diseases transmitted by water, food, vectors and pathologies aggravated by air quality and exposure to extreme weather events. The monitoring of vectors that transmit diseases is carried out by the National Vector Surveillance Network (REVIVE).\nIn order to prevent the negative effects of intense cold or heat, Portugal has a Seasonal Health Contingency Plan  Winter Module and Summer Module. The Water Sanitary Surveillance Programs in the five health regions cover water for human consumption, mineral, natural and spring waters and bathing areas, and have as objectives the surveillance of the microbiological and chemical quality of the water in accordance with its uses.\nRelevant to health, one of the major national issues for reducing quantitative pressures on water bodies is the promotion of water reuse from treated wastewater from any source for multiple purposes. Decree-Law No. 119/2019 of August 21 was published to control the practice, which advocates an approach similar to that provided for Regulation EU 2020/741, supported by the case-by-case definition of quality standards (fit-for-purpose) and risk management on health and environment.\nGood practices for health in the field of adaptation include:\n- Climate risk communication: Improved risk communication and information to the population. The progressive participation of the various public health services and departments in the National Vector Surveillance Network (REVIVE), in the Seasonal Health Contingency Plan  Winter Module and Summer Module and in the Water Sanitary Surveillance Programs, in collaboration with other entities, has allowed gains for the health resulting from knowledge and the better articulation of services.\nAdaptation actions and measures addressing the health sector include:\n- Definition and implementation of measures and strategies of adaptation of the health sector: This measure focuses on the definition and implementation of various actions and strategies to adapt the health sector to climate change.\nInformation from EEA report.

This includes participation in the process of policy making, educational activity, research activity, information provision, and public communication.\nEfforts to integrate climate change adaptation into human health sectoral policies, plans and programs include: monitoring and collecting data; developing warning systems about dangerous for health climate change phenomena; carrying out public education and awareness outreach; working in partnership and cooperation: intra- and intersectoral (local, national, and international); and carrying out research/raising knowledge-base. For the urban environment, adaptation options identify priority scientific topics linked with several aspects including human health.\nAn example of the implementation of measures in the human health sector include, for the period 2021-2022, the Ministry of Health providing BGN 1,496,000 for the capital expenditure budget for medical institutions and for the improvement of the health infrastructures. Human health is also addressed in the project \"We are changing with the climate\" (beneficiary \"Tsvetan Radoslavov\" Secondary School worth BGN 385,465.09), where the main goal is to organize a large-scale campaign to increase the awareness and competences of the Bulgarian public regarding the impact of climate change on human health, the environment and the social and economic life of modern society, as well as the specific climate change mitigation, adaptation and resilience measures to be taken.\nFor healthcare, the rules and conditions for the use of medical assistance for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of diseases, including those arising as a result of the adverse impact of climatic factors, are confirmed and periodically updated by the regulations.\nInformation from EEA report.

The Strategy outlines a long-term vision for the EU to become a climate-resilient society, fully adapted to the unavoidable impacts of climate change by 2050. This strategy aims to reinforce the adaptive capacity of the EU and the world and minimise vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, in line with the Paris Agreement and the European Climate Law\u00a0which writes into law the goal set out in the European Green Deal. The law recognises adaptation as a key component of the long-term global response to climate change and requires Member States and the Union to enhance their adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change. It also introduces a requirement for the implementation of national strategies.\nThe Strategy aims to build a climate resilient society by improving knowledge of climate impacts and adaptation solutions; by stepping up adaptation planning and climate risk assessments; by accelerating adaptation action; and by helping to strengthen climate resilience globally. It pursues three objectives and proposes a range of actions in order to meet them:\n- Smarter adaptation : Improving knowledge and manage uncertainty; including:\n- Pushing the frontiers of adaptation knowledge;\n- More and better climate loss data; and\n- Enhancing and expanding Climate-ADAPT as the European platform for adaptation knowledge.\n- More systemic adaptation : Supporting policy development at all levels and all relevant policy fields; including three cross-cutting priorities to integrate adaptation into:\n- Macro-fiscal policy;\n- Nature-based solutions; and\n- Local adaptation actions.\n- Faster adaptation : Speed up adaptation implementation across the board.\nClimate-ADAPT, the European platform for adaptation knowledge, will be enhanced and expanded.\nAs a first concrete deliverable of the new Strategy, the European Climate and Health Observatory will be launched on Climate-ADAPT, to better track, analyse and prevent the impacts of climate change on human health.\nThe Strategy integrates international action for climate resilience into its framework.\nThe new EU Adaptation Strategy links directly to recent global agreements, such as the Paris Agreement , the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Sustainable Development Agenda as well as the EU implementation of these goals. It also connects directly to major EU initiatives like the Mission for a Climate resilient Europe and the Unions sustainable finance agenda.\nAlso this new EU Adaptation Strategy was part of the Green Deal action plan . The new EU Adaptation Strategy development was based on the evaluation of the 2013 EU strategy on adaptation to climate change and the gathering of a wide range of stakeholder views to i) inform and design the explored policy options, as well as ii) the appropriate level of ambition. An extensive Blueprint of the new EU Strategy was provided as part of the open consultation process in 2020 to stimulate public debate and an impact assessment was made.\nThe 2018 Commissions evaluation of the (2013) EU Adaptation Strategy finds that this strategy had delivered on its objectives to promote action by Member States, climate-proof action at the EU level and support better-informed decision-making. The evaluation included the adaptation preparedness scoreboard for measuring Member States level of readiness based on qualitative, process-based indicators.\nLanguage preference detected\nDo you want to see the page translated into ?

It also introduces a requirement for the implementation of national strategies.\nThe Strategy aims to build a climate resilient society by improving knowledge of climate impacts and adaptation solutions; by stepping up adaptation planning and climate risk assessments; by accelerating adaptation action; and by helping to strengthen climate resilience globally. It pursues three objectives and proposes a range of actions in order to meet them:\n- Smarter adaptation : Improving knowledge and manage uncertainty; including:\n- Pushing the frontiers of adaptation knowledge;\n- More and better climate loss data; and\n- Enhancing and expanding Climate-ADAPT as the European platform for adaptation knowledge.\n- More systemic adaptation : Supporting policy development at all levels and all relevant policy fields; including three cross-cutting priorities to integrate adaptation into:\n- Macro-fiscal policy;\n- Nature-based solutions; and\n- Local adaptation actions.\n- Faster adaptation : Speed up adaptation implementation across the board.\nClimate-ADAPT, the European platform for adaptation knowledge, will be enhanced and expanded.\nAs a first concrete deliverable of the new Strategy, the European Climate and Health Observatory will be launched on Climate-ADAPT, to better track, analyse and prevent the impacts of climate change on human health.\nThe Strategy integrates international action for climate resilience into its framework.\nThe new EU Adaptation Strategy links directly to recent global agreements, such as the Paris Agreement , the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Sustainable Development Agenda as well as the EU implementation of these goals. It also connects directly to major EU initiatives like the Mission for a Climate resilient Europe and the Unions sustainable finance agenda.\nAlso this new EU Adaptation Strategy was part of the Green Deal action plan . The new EU Adaptation Strategy development was based on the evaluation of the 2013 EU strategy on adaptation to climate change and the gathering of a wide range of stakeholder views to i) inform and design the explored policy options, as well as ii) the appropriate level of ambition. An extensive Blueprint of the new EU Strategy was provided as part of the open consultation process in 2020 to stimulate public debate and an impact assessment was made.\nThe 2018 Commissions evaluation of the (2013) EU Adaptation Strategy finds that this strategy had delivered on its objectives to promote action by Member States, climate-proof action at the EU level and support better-informed decision-making. The evaluation included the adaptation preparedness scoreboard for measuring Member States level of readiness based on qualitative, process-based indicators.\nLanguage preference detected\nDo you want to see the page translated into ?

In this regard, the programme advocate coordinated and harmonised measures within transnationally relevant ecological regions ensuring resilience and adaptation to climate change to reduce its impacts on biodiversity.\nIn the programming period 2014-2020, the Danube Interreg Programme dealt with challenges related to climate change mainly in the context of transnational water management, flood management and related risk management. Climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction were explicitly considered under priority 2, corresponding to the programme's thematic objective on Environment and resource efficiency (TO6).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Macro-region strategies\nThe\u00a0EU Strategy for the Danube Region\u00a0(EUSDR), adopted by the European Commission in December 2010 and endorsed by the European Council in 2011, is a macro-regional strategy which was jointly developed by the EC, Danube countries and stakeholders in order to address common challenges together. The strategy seeks to create synergies and coordination between existing policies and initiatives taking place across the Danube region.\nThe revised \u00a0EU Action Plan\u00a0(2020) for the EUSDR has three main goals: to update and streamline the actions stated in the previous Action Plan of the region (2010); to provide more strategic guidance for the implementation of the EUSDR; to achieve a better compatibility of the EUSDR Action Plan with other programmes and funding instruments. The Plan identifies a portfolio of 85 actions for the 12 Priority Areas (PA) identified by the EUSDR. Climate change impacts and climate adaptation issues prominently feature in the environmental pillar of the strategy, which is composed of Priority Area 4 To restore and maintain the quality of waters (PA4), Priority Area 5 To manage environmental risks (PA5) and Priority Area 6 To preserve biodiversity, landscapes and the quality of air and soils (PA6). Among these,\u00a0PA5\u00a0has the highest relevance to adaptation. The EUSDR Action Plan encourages actions to: anticipate regional and local impacts of climate change for disaster risk reduction (Actions 2, 3, 4, 5, PA5); adapt to climate change impacts on water quality and quantity and to support smart uses of the water resource (Action 6, PA4); ecologically restore wetlands, especially in the Danube delta (Action 10, PA6).\n\n...\n\nAt the Fifth meeting of the Conference of Parties to the Carpathian Convention (COP5, 2017) an amendment to the Carpathian Convention was adopted to include a new Article on Climate Change (12bis). It requests Parties to pursue policies aiming at climate change mitigation and adaptation in all sectors relevant to the Convention. Consequently, the long term Vision 2030 for the Carpathian area was established to strengthen collaborative efforts towards a climate-neutral path that delivers climate-resilient and sustainable development in the Carpathians. This vision, aligned with the implementation of the Article 12bis of the Carpathian Convention, is detailed in seven strategic objectives and concrete targets. The Working Group on Climate Change supports the implementation of the Convention with special focus on this article. It works towards the long-term Vision 2030 and actively promotes pathways for climate proof development in relevant sectors.\nDetailed information\u00a0including links to the most relevant documents on adaptation in the Carpathian mountains is provided by the Secretariat of the Carpathian Convention based on submission from the Convention\u00b4s Working Group on Adaptation to Climate Change.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adaptation strategies and plans\nIn response to the Danube Declaration, a Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change\u00a0of the ICPDR was adopted in December 2012 and updated in 2018. The ICPDR Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change aims at offering guidance on the integration of climate change adaptation into ICPDR planning processes. It promotes multilateral and transboundary cooperation action in the context of climate change adaptation and serves as a reference for national policy makers and other officials. The Strategy provides the knowledge base and a strategic framework for integrating adaptation to climate change in the water sector into the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive and the EU Floods Directive.

The process for submitting information varies for the different sections of the platform. External providers can submit information to the platform as described in the\u00a0Share your information\u00a0webpage.\nWhat is the target audience of Climate-ADAPT?\nClimate-ADAPT is designed to assist governmental decision-makers (and organisations providing them support such as agencies, boundary organisations and research institutes) working on the development and implementation of adaptation strategies or actions at EU, transnational, national and sub-national level (e.g. cities).\nWhat is the\u00a0specific\u00a0focus of the Climate-ADAPT resource catalogue?\nThe Climate-ADAPT resource catalogue enables users to get an overview of the available knowledge on climate change adaptation in Europe.\u00a0The Climate-ADAPT resource catalogue provides access to all relevant sources of information by using tailored search criteria and allows a quick overview by screening the metadata available for each information source. The resource catalogue information is structured in 10 different types of data and is organized in 19 sectors, 7 climate impacts, 9 adaptation elements, different geographic levels and by year.\nCan items with a focus outside climate change adaptation be submitted to the Climate-ADAPT resource catalogue?\nNo, resource catalogue items, news and events with a focus on e.g. climate change mitigation or sustainable management but with no explicit connection with climate change adaptation are outside the scope of the Climate-ADAPT and are therefore not eligible.\nAre exceptions to the defined focus of the Climate-ADAPT possible?\nA notable exception refers to documents on EU policies for which efforts to mainstream adaptation are undertaken. For an explanation of these policies, see the pages on\u00a0EU sector policies .\nFor instance, the Habitats Directive, even if it does not explicitly mention climate change, is very relevant for the mainstreaming of adaptation in biodiversity policies.\nWhat level of scientific detail can be included in documents submitted to the Climate-ADAPT resource catalogue?\nThe information submitted should be available in a language that is understandable for the intended Climate-ADAPT target audience (see above). Very specialised and technical documents written for technical experts are excluded.\nAre articles published in scientific journals eligible for the Climate-ADAPT resource catalogue ?\nPeer-reviewed scientific articles should not be included in Climate-ADAPT unless they are relevant for the target audience of the platform. In this case, they have to be open access and in English.\nAre items in national languages eligible to the Climate-ADAPT resource catalogue ?\nNo. Since the aim of Climate-ADAPT is to easily share information on adaptation across Europe, items should either be in English or at least include an English summary. This does not include abstracts of scientific articles.\nGEOGRAPHIC SCOPE\nCan items with a geographic context outside the EEA member and cooperating countries be submitted to Climate-ADAPT?\nResource catalogue items focussing on climate change impacts, vulnerability and/or adaptation beyond the scope of the EU and\u00a0EEA member countries\u00a0are eligible for inclusion in the Climate-ADAPT resource catalogue only when: i) they are very relevant to Europe (to be explained in the description' field in the metadata sheet); or ii) the source of the information is the European Commission, its contractors or relevant international organisations (such as WHO Europe, ISDR Europe, OECD, IPCC); or iii) they cover Europe as a whole or parts of it.\nWhat does the \"global\" label mean, with reference to the Geographic Information' area in the template for Climate-ADAPT resource catalogue submissions?\nThe \"global\" label in the Geographic Information' field of the metadata sheet for resource catalogue items refers either to items that are of a general methodological scope or that have worldwide coverage, in which Europe is included (e.g. IPCC reports).\nCan information that is highly relevant for Europe, but analysed, assessed or implemented elsewhere than in EU or EEA countries, be submitted to Climate-ADAPT?\nGenerally not. A notable exception refers to the Climate-ADAPT resource catalogue category \"adaptation options\".\nIn this case, please contact the Climate-ADAPT support team via\u00a0climate.adapt@eea.europa.eu\nFILLING OUT THE SUBMISSION TEMPLATE\u00a0FOR RESOURCE CATALOGUE ITEMS\nWhat should be considered before submitting a new item to the Climate-ADAPT resource catalogue ?\nOnce it is certain that the item is eligible (geographical relevance, focus on climate change vulnerability and/or adaptation), please check if it is already present in the platform by\u00a0searching the resource catalogue .\nHow can new Climate-ADAPT resource catalogue items be classified among the different eligible types of information?\nThe\u00a0resource catalogue type categories\u00a0are self-explanatory and intuitive.

To this end, the project aims to accelerate the climate-resilient transformation of 10 European mountain regions.\nOf these, 6 demonstrator regions develop and test transformative solutions. The Romanian demonstrator site for instance focus on increasing the fertility of mountain meadows to support local farmers in the face of climate change (through field scanning, drone seeding ). The Finish Lapland demonstrator aims at adapting the regions nature-based livelihoods (relying essentially on reindeer herding and tourism) by providing them with specific data on the effects of climate change as well as adaptation plans and adequate coaching for the different stakeholders involved. The Piemonte region (Italy) and Canton Valais (Switzerland) both focus on water monitoring and increasing the efficiency of its usage. The Austrian Tirol region work on the adaptation of the tourism sector (both in winter and summer seasons) through developing nature-based offers and testing building adaptations for instance. Finally, the city of Gabrovo in Bulgaria aim at improving the life of the local population in the face of climate change through greening the public infrastructures as well as developing an early warning and monitoring tool for risk management.\nThe remaining 4 regions will act as replicators, applying the solutions and lessons learned from the demo regions in their regions through special initiatives to improve their adaptive capacity.\n\n...\n\nDezvoltare Pentru Montanologie Cristian - SIBIU\u00a0(Romania)\nRohealth - Clusterul Pentru S\u0103N\u0103Tate \u0219I Bioeconomie\u00a0(Romania)\nComuna R\u00e2u Sadului\u00a0(Romania)\nSocial Finance Association - Asocia\u021bia pentru Finan\u021bare Social\u0103\u00a0(Romania)\nCentro De Investigaci\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica y Aplicaciones Forestales (Spain)\nDepartament de Territori - Generalitat de Catalunya (Spain)\n\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (Switzerland)\nBlueArk Entremont\u00a0(Switzerland)\nCanton de Valais  Kanton Wallis\u00a0(Switzerland)\nApptitude SA\u00a0(Switzerland)\nFondation pour le d\u00e9veloppement durable des r\u00e9gions de montagne\u00a0(Switzerland)\n\u00a0\nReference information Websites:\nhttps://mountresilience.eu/#home\nhttps://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101112876\nPublished in Climate-ADAPT\u00a0Jan 19, 2024\u00a0 - \u00a0 Last Modified in Climate-ADAPT\u00a0Feb 2, 2024\nShare your information\nDate of creation:\n2024 Keywords: EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change, adaptation governance, societal engagement, sustainable mountains Climate impacts:\nDroughts, Extreme Temperatures, Flooding, Water Scarcity Adaptation Approaches:\nSector Policies, Adaptation Measures and Actions, Nature-based solutions Sectors:\nMountain areas Funding Programme: Horizon Europe Duration: 2023-2028 Geographic characterisation:\nEurope Biogeographical regions:\nAlpine Countries:\nAustria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland, France, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland\nLanguage preference detected\nDo you want to see the page translated into ?

In doing so, each implementation step represents a building block that is linked to time horizons and considers uncertainty along the implementation process. Adaptation pathways offer a conceptual framework for flexible policy planning, enabling an iterative and dynamic implementation process to deal with uncertainties, manage change within complex socio-ecological systems, and limit undesirable and mal-adaptive consequences. Adaptation pathways are composed of a sequence of possible actions resembling a decision tree. Over the course of time, possible tipping points (e.g., climate events, changes in external framework conditions) may trigger a review mechanism to check if the line of action still meets the specified objective or not. This may result in the need to shift to another implementation pathway. When connected with sound monitoring and evaluation of implementation, this approach can help to support learning over time and increase resilience or adaptive capacity.\nSource: Zandvoort et al. (2017): Adaptation pathways in planning for uncertain climate change: Applications in Portugal, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands. Environmental Science and Policy 78 (2017) 1826.\nLearning from good examples from transnational, national and subnational levels\nAvailable adaptation strategies and action plans of other European countries as well as such existing in some transnational (macro-)regions can serve as helpful examples for countries or governments at sub-national territorial levels in developing their own adaptation planning documents. It is best to assess and compare documents from several countries, learn from best practices and apply them in a customized way. Transnational cooperation structures and networks, such as European transnational cooperation regions , macro-regional strategies and international conventions, can greatly support sharing of knowledge and mutual learning of experiences between countries and regions. Transnational networking can also help to better align adaptation policy making at EU, transnational and domestic levels and to consider transboundary adaptation issues in adaptation policy documents.\nClimate-ADAPT database items\nGuidelines on developing adaptation strategies\nNational adaptation policy processes in European countries  2014\nAdditional resources\nCountry Profiles\nTransnational regions\nMapping governance of adaptation to climate change in the Alpine Space\nAdaptation policies and knowledge base in transnational regions in Europe\nRationale, approach and added value of Key Type of Measures for adaptation to climate change\nRead more\nUsing Key Type Measures to report climate adaptation action in the EEA member countries\nLanguage preference detected\nDo you want to see the page translated into ?

The process for submitting information varies for the different sections of the platform. External providers can submit information to the platform as described in the\u00a0Share your information\u00a0webpage.\nWhat is the target audience of Climate-ADAPT?\nClimate-ADAPT is designed to assist governmental decision-makers (and organisations providing them support such as agencies, boundary organisations and research institutes) working on the development and implementation of adaptation strategies or actions at EU, transnational, national and sub-national level (e.g. cities).\nWhat is the\u00a0specific\u00a0focus of the Climate-ADAPT database?\nThe Climate-ADAPT database enables users to get an overview of the available knowledge on climate change adaptation in Europe.\u00a0The Climate-ADAPT database provides access to all relevant sources of information by using tailored search criteria and allows a quick overview by screening the metadata available for each information source. The database information is structured in 10 different types of data and is organized in 19 sectors, 7 climate impacts, 9 adaptation elements, different geographic levels and by year.\nCan items with a focus outside climate change adaptation be submitted to the Climate-ADAPT database?\nNo. Database items, news and events with a focus on e.g. climate change mitigation or sustainable management but with no explicit connection with climate change adaptation are outside the scope of the Climate-ADAPT and are therefore not eligible.\nAre exceptions to the defined focus of the Climate-ADAPT possible?\nA notable exception refers to documents on EU policies for which efforts to mainstream adaptation are undertaken.

The briefing shows that highlighting examples of adaptation actions can boost learning across the EU, Member States as well as regional and local authorities to help societies better prepare for climate change\u00a0\nNine criteria have been defined for selecting and presenting Climate-ADAPT case studies.\nCase studies serve as inspiration on how known adaptation options can be implemented in practice under a range of different conditions.\u00a0\nThis collection is regularly updated with new case studies, aiming to reach a balanced distribution of represented sectors, climate-related impacts, approaches applied and geographic locations. Case studies included are also periodically reassessed and updated, to track both the process and the effectiveness of adaptation actions across Europe.\u00a0\u00a0\nAccess to Climate-ADAPT Case studies\nTo learn from diverse experiences, explore Climate-ADAPT case studies through the map-basedCase study explorer below. Case studies can be explored through the following three filters:\nAdaptation Sectors  Users can navigate across 19 adaptation sectors addressed by the case studies in terms of climate change adaptation.\nClimate Impacts  This filter enables users to filter case studies through climate change impacts they cope with.\nKey Type Measures - This filter enables users to select case studies through the categories of adaptation options implemented. The adaptation options are labelled by Key Type Measures (KTM).\u00a0 The KTM are a common framework and reporting approach for climate change adaptation that allows clustering the wider variety of adaptation options and measures across EEA Member countries.", "blurb": "Skip to main content Skip to navigation Skip to footer\nAn official website of the European Union | How do you know?\nAll official European Union website addresses are in the europa.eu domain.

They normally address a specific climate impact and/or adaptation sector. The planning of adaptation actions is taking place at the Carpathian Mountains which are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\nThe  Future imperfect: Climate change and adaptation in the Carpathians  document summarizes key adaptation actions in vulnerable sectors of the region: water resources, forests, wetlands, grasslands, agriculture and tourism. By adopting the Strategic Agenda on Adaptation to Climate Change in the Carpathian Region , the Conference of the Parties (COP) calls upon the contracting parties, local and regional authorities and other stakeholders involved in management and development of the Carpathian region to formulate policies and design strategies to adapt to climate change impacts and to mitigate its adverse effects.The aim of the agenda is to assist Member States of the Carpathian Convention , local and regional authorities and other stakeholders involved in management of the Carpathian region to formulate responses to climate change as a way to secure the sustainable development in the region. The Agenda has been discussed at meetings and workshops with Country representatives and observers to the Carpathian Convention as well as other interested stakeholders. It was endorsed at the Fourth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Carpathian Convention (COP4) 23-26 September 2014.The Strategic Agenda includes recommendations for policy development, institutional change and ecosystem-based adaptation measures. In summary, it infers that linking different policies of nature conservation, river basin management, and sustainable farming could significantly strengthen the Carpathian region and its resilience to climate change.\nThe added value of increased transnational cooperation and joint activities is especially important when planning for climate change adaptation, since many of the predicted impacts of climate change, such as seasonal changes in temperature and precipitation, will occur over vast geographical areas, affecting several countries at once.\u00a0\nMainstreaming of adaptation in other policy sectors\nAdaptation measures for water resources\nOne of the most efficient adaptation measures against the combined threat of droughts and floods in the Carpathian Mountains is local water storage.Storage capacity can be increased by blocking (old) drainage canals which were dug in the past but which often do not serve a purpose anymore. Eliminating road networks can also encourage storage, especially in the Eastern Carpathians. However, eliminating roads necessitates adjusting land use. Activities requiring frequent transportation (e.g. hay production) have to be replaced by transportation-free uses, such as grazing or nature conservation. (Re)creating wetlands and ponds increases storage capacity and allows to harvest rainwater. Structural measures such as constructing dams, water tanks and subsurface reservoirs also help. However, dam construction has to be carefully planned so as not to damage river ecosystems.Sub-surface water storage can be enhanced by protecting and restoring natural grasslands so more rainwater can infiltrate into the deeper soil layers. This land use measure is especially recommended for the karstic systems in the Carpathian region, where grasslands are the primary sources of water supply for the sub-surface water resources.\nAdaptation measures for forests and forestry\nThe Carpathian countries have limited capacity to take measures to help forests and forestry adapt to climate change. None of them has yet directly addressed climate change in its forestry legislation (although the issue is usually included in national strategies). Adaptive capacity is substantially lower in the Romanian and Serbian part of the Carpathian region compared to the Western Carpathians.Adaptation should be geared to practical forest management and legislation, and ensuring that risk assessment is considered in forest planning and management. This is becoming increasingly important and there is a need to change the traditional timber production-oriented management towards an adaptive risk-responsive management. Adaptive forest management uses concepts such as continuous-cover-forestry and close-to-nature forestry to increase adaptive capacity of forests and lower anticipated risks. It increases the proportion of drought tolerant species, mainly oaks, and reduces the proportion of vulnerable water demanding conifers and beech at lower elevations. Changes in tree species composition supporting forests' drought tolerance need to be promoted. At the same time, the share of vulnerable Norway spruce forests needs to be substantially reduced.", "blurb": "Skip to main content Skip to navigation Skip to footer\nAn official website of the European Union | How do you know?\nAll official European Union website addresses are in the europa.eu domain.

(Re)creating wetlands and ponds increases storage capacity and allows to harvest rainwater. Structural measures such as constructing dams, water tanks and subsurface reservoirs also help. However, dam construction has to be carefully planned so as not to damage river ecosystems.Sub-surface water storage can be enhanced by protecting and restoring natural grasslands so more rainwater can infiltrate into the deeper soil layers. This land use measure is especially recommended for the karstic systems in the Carpathian region, where grasslands are the primary sources of water supply for the sub-surface water resources.\nAdaptation measures for forests and forestry\nThe Carpathian countries have limited capacity to take measures to help forests and forestry adapt to climate change. None of them has yet directly addressed climate change in its forestry legislation (although the issue is usually included in national strategies). Adaptive capacity is substantially lower in the Romanian and Serbian part of the Carpathian region compared to the Western Carpathians.Adaptation should be geared to practical forest management and legislation, and ensuring that risk assessment is considered in forest planning and management. This is becoming increasingly important and there is a need to change the traditional timber production-oriented management towards an adaptive risk-responsive management. Adaptive forest management uses concepts such as continuous-cover-forestry and close-to-nature forestry to increase adaptive capacity of forests and lower anticipated risks. It increases the proportion of drought tolerant species, mainly oaks, and reduces the proportion of vulnerable water demanding conifers and beech at lower elevations. Changes in tree species composition supporting forests' drought tolerance need to be promoted. At the same time, the share of vulnerable Norway spruce forests needs to be substantially reduced.", "blurb": "Skip to main content Skip to navigation Skip to footer\nAn official website of the European Union | How do you know?\nAll official European Union website addresses are in the europa.eu domain.", "semantic_identifier": "Adaptation Actions", "source_type": "web", "metadata": {}, "updated_at": null, "link": "https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/countries-regions/transnational-regions/carpathian-mountains/adaptation-actions", "source_links": {"0": "https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/countries-regions/transnational-regions/carpathian-mountains/adaptation-actions"}, "match_highlights": ["", "grasslands, agriculture and tourism.

Although the Convention does not mention climate change adaptation among its priorities, it aims to mitigate several environmental problems that are expected to be negatively affected by climate change, such as biodiversity and marine ecosystems preservation.\nThe main economic cooperation framework in the area is the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC). BSEC has adopted in December 2017 its own climate change adaptation strategy , which includes the following priorities:\n- Promoting regional cooperation in combating climate change across the BSEC area.

They normally address a specific climate impact and/or adaptation sector. The planning of adaptation actions is taking place at the Carpathian Mountains which are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\nThe  Future imperfect: Climate change and adaptation in the Carpathians  document summarizes key adaptation actions in vulnerable sectors of the region: water resources, forests, wetlands, grasslands, agriculture and tourism. By adopting the Strategic Agenda on Adaptation to Climate Change in the Carpathian Region , the Conference of the Parties (COP) calls upon the contracting parties, local and regional authorities and other stakeholders involved in management and development of the Carpathian region to formulate policies and design strategies to adapt to climate change impacts and to mitigate its adverse effects.The aim of the agenda is to assist Member States of the Carpathian Convention , local and regional authorities and other stakeholders involved in management of the Carpathian region to formulate responses to climate change as a way to secure the sustainable development in the region. The Agenda has been discussed at meetings and workshops with Country representatives and observers to the Carpathian Convention as well as other interested stakeholders. It was endorsed at the Fourth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Carpathian Convention (COP4) 23-26 September 2014.The Strategic Agenda includes recommendations for policy development, institutional change and ecosystem-based adaptation measures. In summary, it infers that linking different policies of nature conservation, river basin management, and sustainable farming could significantly strengthen the Carpathian region and its resilience to climate change.", "blurb": "Skip to main content Skip to navigation Skip to footer\nAn official website of the European Union | How do you know?\nAll official European Union website addresses are in the europa.eu domain.

The process for submitting information varies for the different sections of the platform. External providers can submit information to the platform as described in the\u00a0Share your information\u00a0webpage.\nWhat is the target audience of Climate-ADAPT?\nClimate-ADAPT is designed to assist governmental decision-makers (and organisations providing them support such as agencies, boundary organisations and research institutes) working on the development and implementation of adaptation strategies or actions at EU, transnational, national and sub-national level (e.g. cities).\nWhat is the\u00a0specific\u00a0focus of the Climate-ADAPT database?\nThe Climate-ADAPT database enables users to get an overview of the available knowledge on climate change adaptation in Europe.\u00a0The Climate-ADAPT database provides access to all relevant sources of information by using tailored search criteria and allows a quick overview by screening the metadata available for each information source. The database information is structured in 10 different types of data and is organized in 19 sectors, 7 climate impacts, 9 adaptation elements, different geographic levels and by year.\nCan items with a focus outside climate change adaptation be submitted to the Climate-ADAPT database?\nNo. Database items, news and events with a focus on e.g. climate change mitigation or sustainable management but with no explicit connection with climate change adaptation are outside the scope of the Climate-ADAPT and are therefore not eligible.\nAre exceptions to the defined focus of the Climate-ADAPT possible?\nA notable exception refers to documents on EU policies for which efforts to mainstream adaptation are undertaken. For an explanation of these policies, see the pages on\u00a0EU sector policies .\nFor instance, the Habitats Directive, even if it does not explicitly mention climate change, is very relevant for the mainstreaming of adaptation in biodiversity policies.\nWhat level of scientific detail can be included in documents submitted to the Climate-ADAPT database?\nThe information submitted should be available in a language that is understandable for the intended Climate-ADAPT target audience (see above). Very specialised and technical documents written for technical experts are excluded.\nAre articles published in scientific journals eligible for the Climate-ADAPT database?\nPeer-reviewed scientific articles should not be included in Climate-ADAPT unless they are relevant for the target audience of the platform. In this case, they have to be open access and in English.\nAre items in national languages eligible to the Climate-ADAPT database?\nNo. Since the aim of Climate-ADAPT is to easily share information on adaptation across Europe, items should either be in English or at least include an English summary. This does not include abstracts of scientific articles.\nGEOGRAPHIC SCOPE\nCan items with a geographic context outside the EEA member and cooperating countries be submitted to Climate-ADAPT?\nDatabase items focussing on climate change impacts, vulnerability and/or adaptation beyond the scope of the EU and\u00a0EEA member countries\u00a0are eligible for inclusion in the Climate-ADAPT database only when: i) they are very relevant to Europe (to be explained in the description' field in the metadata sheet); or ii) the source of the information is the European Commission, its contractors or relevant international organisations (such as WHO Europe, ISDR Europe, OECD, IPCC); or iii) they cover Europe as a whole or parts of it.\nWhat does the \"global\" label mean, with reference to the Geographic Information' area in the template for Climate-ADAPT database submissions?\nThe \"global\" label in the Geographic Information' field of the metadata sheet for database items refers either to items that are of a general methodological scope or that have worldwide coverage, in which Europe is included (e.g. IPCC reports).\nCan information that is highly relevant for Europe, but analysed, assessed or implemented elsewhere than in EU or EEA countries, be submitted to Climate-ADAPT?\nGenerally not. A notable exception refers to the Climate-ADAPT database category \"adaptation options\".

The briefing shows that highlighting examples of adaptation actions can boost learning across the EU, Member States as well as regional and local authorities to help societies better prepare for climate change\u00a0\nNine criteria have been defined for selecting and presenting Climate-ADAPT case studies.\nCase studies serve as inspiration on how known adaptation options can be implemented in practice under a range of different conditions.\u00a0\nThis collection is regularly updated with new case studies, aiming to reach a balanced distribution of represented sectors, climate-related impacts, approaches applied and geographic locations. Case studies included are also periodically reassessed and updated, to track both the process and the effectiveness of adaptation actions across Europe.\u00a0\u00a0\nAccess to Climate-ADAPT Case studies\nTo learn from diverse experiences, explore Climate-ADAPT case studies through the map-basedCase study explorer below. Case studies can be explored through the following three filters:\nAdaptation Sectors  Users can navigate across 19 adaptation sectors addressed by the case studies in terms of climate change adaptation.\nClimate Impacts  This filter enables users to filter case studies through climate change impacts they cope with.\nKey Type Measures - This filter enables users to select case studies through the categories of adaptation options implemented. The adaptation options are labelled by Key Type Measures (KTM).\u00a0 The KTM are a common framework and reporting approach for climate change adaptation that allows clustering the wider variety of adaptation options and measures across EEA Member countries.\nAdaptation approaches - This filter allows to select case studies with explicit descriptions of how adaptation approaches were applied in the case studies which are key for leaning on the effectiveness of adaptation actions and governance settings. Examplese are the availability of monitoring, learning and evaluation (MLE), the consideration of environmental, economic and social co-benefits and trade-offs, and the replication and/or upscaling potential of adaptation actions described in the case studies.\nAdaptation sectors\nClimate impacts\nKey type measures\nAdaptation approaches\nClimate-ADAPT case studies\nYou can also access case studies through theClimate-ADAPT resource catalogue. The catalogue enables filtering case studies by adaptation sectors they address, climate impacts  they cope with, adaptation elements they apply and by countries and transnational regions where they are located.\nHow to share case studies on Climate-ADAPT\n\t\tCase studies are developed by the European Environment Agency (EEA), with the support of the European Topic Centre on Climate Change Adaptation and LULUCF ( ETC CA , former ETC/CCA) and with key collaboration of the organisations responsible for their implementation. Climate-ADAPT stakeholders are welcome to share information about their own experiences that meet case study criteria by contacting climate.adapt@eea.europa.eu . Find case study catalogues of EEA Member countries Climate-ADAPT case studies complement case study catalogues, prepared at national levels by EEA Member countries. Together, the EEA and EEA Member countries aim to give policymakers and practitioners in the EU the best available practical examples to reach agreed environmental and sustainability targets through adaptation actions.

Mititelu, WWF\nThe Lower Danube Green Corridor Agreement, initiated in 2000 by Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, and Moldova, focuses on restoring wetlands, reconnecting the river to natural floodplains, and improving local economies. Positive outcomes include enhanced flood resilience, biodiversity, and economic diversification.\nIn 2000, the governments of Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Moldova pledged to work together  with the signing of the Lower Danube Green Corridor Agreement - to establish a green corridor along the entire length of the Lower Danube River (~1,000 km). All partners recognized a need and shared responsibility to protect and manage the Lower Danube in a sustainable way. The Lower Danube Green Corridor Agreement aimed to protect and restore wetlands along the river and reconnect the river to its natural flooding areas, reducing the risks of major flooding in areas with human settlements and offering benefits both for local economies  e.g. through fisheries, tourism  and for the ecosystems along the river. The current outcomes of the initiative show that the restoration projects have provided many benefits, including improved natural capacity to retain and release floodwaters, enhanced biodiversity, and strengthened local economies through diversification of livelihoods based on natural resources. The implemented measures are expected to increase resilience of natural systems and local societies in managing current climate variability and the likely impacts of further climate change.\nCase Study Description\nChallenges\nObjectives of the adaptation measure\nAdaptation Options Implemented In This Case\nSolutions\nImportance and Relevance of Adaptation\nAdditional Details\nStakeholder participation\nSuccess and limiting factors\nCosts and benefits\nLegal aspects\nImplementation time\nLifetime\nReference Information\nContact\nWebsites\nSource\nCase Study Description\nChallenges\nAgriculture, forestry and transport have taken their toll on the naturalness of the Lower Danube.\n\n...\n\nIn Romania, 6,000 hectares of floodplains on the islands of Babina and Cernovca, Mahmudia, Balta Geraiului, G\u00e2rla Mare - Vrata have been or are being reconnected to the river, creating a mosaic of habitats. As natural processes have been re-established, numerous bird species have come back and fish populations have increased. On Tataru Island in Ukraine, traditional cattle breeds were brought in to control invasive species. Dikes were removed to allow 750 hectares of land to flood naturally, providing rich feeding, breeding and spawning grounds for wildlife. As of today, some restoration projects are still ongoing, such as the G\u00e2rla Mare and Vrata ones that will have an impact on an area of 2000 ha.\nDecommissioning under-performing flood protection dikes and restoring floodplains is contributing to safer and more effective floodwater retention, more robust and dependable freshwater ecosystem services, lower infrastructure maintenance costs and strengthened local economies through diversification of livelihoods based on natural resources. During the 2013 flood in the Danube, along the Lower Danube there was no flooding, although water was above the average level.\nRelevance\nCase mainly developed and implemented because of other policy objectives, but with significant consideration of climate change adaptation aspects.\nAdditional Details\nStakeholder participation\nWWF has taken responsibility for the Lower Danube Green Corridor initiative as part of the WWF Living Planet Programme which is aimed to secure the conservation of important biological resources and ecosystems into the next millennium. In the Lower Danube Green Corridor project, WWF works closely with the governments of the countries - Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova and Ukraine - that signed the Agreement, as well as local stakeholders. To achieve the objectives, each country prepared an action plan in which additional areas of floodplain were designated for protection and restoration. These action plans described for each designated area what specific measures were needed and what steps had to be taken to carry out these measures.\nInvolved stakeholders supported a regular exchange of information - through meetings and by establishing contact points at the Ministries of Environment in the four participating countries - in order to achieve effective protection of the Lower Danube Green Corridor. WWF played a facilitator role to increase communication and cooperation between the Lower Danube Green Corridor countries. It also supported the implementation of concrete restoration projects, like models to be scaled up.\nBoth citizens and environmental NGOs were offered the opportunity to play an active role in decision making processes. WWF has conducted awareness raising campaigns and also directly engaged the general public and NGOs in the decision making process in the project area.\nActive lobbying has been done at national and international levels to boost the implementation of the Lower Danube Green Corridor.\nFurthermore, partners were sought locally and nationally as well as internationally, i.e. GEF, UNDP, UNEP, World Bank, EU, WWF, IUCN, Ramsar Convention and other Governments (i.e. Austria, Germany, Denmark, Netherlands), to solicit their co-operation and assistance in the creation and maintenance of a Lower Danube Green Corridor. The main funding came from WWF, national governments, EU and the business sector.\nNowadays, due to political changes, the main challenge for WWFs activities is to furthermore convince the authorities about the multi-beneficial effects of nature-based solutions, such as floodplain and wetland restoration to increase climate change resilience.\nSuccess and limiting factors\nInternational agreements for better water and river management have been a powerful tool for change in the Danube River Basin. Restoring the natural resilience of the environment to climate events (in this case large-scale adaptation) by decommissioning under-performing water infrastructure and thereby improving the natural capacity to retain and release peak floods, brings additional benefits both for nature and people. New opportunities for eco-tourism, fishing, grazing and fibre production strengthen local economies. The resulting higher quality of habitats attracts a wider range of species, including endangered ones.\nThe Lower Danube Green Corridor Agreement served as an excellent basis to translate governmental decisions into actions. In countries like Romania and Bulgaria, the implementation of the Natura 2000 network significantly contributed to increasing the area under protection. Also, the harmonisation of the environmental legislation with the EU requirements, especially the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, opened new opportunities to restore lateral connectivity. In other cases, the need of the local communities to have access to enhanced natural resources was the main driver.\nProper attention to the issue of land ownership was the key to success in the project. In each restoration project a few to a dozen landowners - depending on the size of the restoration area - had to be convinced that a change in land use would be beneficial for them. In the case of private landowners, it was important to assure that they do not lose the property rights. WWF started two pilot projects in Romania, where local communities and individuals gave their land to be flooded. The trigger to accept such rigorous change in land use was the understanding of the benefits deriving from changing the unproductive arable land into wetlands.\n\n...\n\nReference Information\nContact\nOrieta Hulea\nConservation Director WWF International\nDanube-Carpathian Programme\nE-mail: ohulea@wwfdcp.ro\u00a0\nCamelia Ionescu\nFreshwater Project Manager\nWWF Romania\nE-mail: cionescu@wwf.ro\u00a0\nIulia Puiu\nProject Manager for Wetland Restoration Projects\nWWF Romania\nE-mail: ipuiu@wwf.ro\u00a0\nWebsites\nhttp://danube.panda.org/wwf/web/search/details.jsp?pid=41\nhttps://wwfeu.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/lessons_learnt_fromthe_lower_danube_landscape.pdf\nhttp://iopscience.iop.org/1755-1315/6/40/402002\nReferences\nWWF International Danube-Carpathian Programme\nPublished in Climate-ADAPT : Jun 7, 2016\nPlease contact us for any other enquiry on this Case Study or to share a new Case Study (email climate.adapt@eea.europa.eu )\nShare your information\nCase Study illustrations ( 6 )\nDate of creation:\n2020 Keywords: Biodiversity enhancement, Danube, ecosystem services, flood management, floodplain restoration, green corridor Climate impacts:\nFlooding Adaptation Approaches:\nEconomic aspects, Environmental aspects, Adaptation Measures and Actions, Nature-based solutions, Adaptation Plans and Strategies, Societal aspects Sectors:\nBiodiversity, Disaster Risk Reduction, Forestry, Water management Governance level: Transnational region (stretching across country borders) Geographic characterisation:\nEurope Macro-Transnational region:\nDanube Area, Black Sea Basin (NEXT), Mediterranean (Euro-Med) Biogeographical regions:\nContinental Countries:\nBulgaria, Romania\nHealth impact:\n-NONSPECIFIC-\nCase Studies Documents ( 1 )\nWWF Fact Sheet 2015\nLanguage preference detected\nDo you want to see the page translated into ?

The majority of countries also reported that their health sector is at medium or high risk of future climate change impacts. Croatia , Hungary , Latvia , Portugal , and Slovakia reported high levels of concern across all four categories. Some of the key climate related health hazards identified by CCRVA include outbreaks of infectious disease, heat stress, drought, flooding, and the spread of allergens.\nCountry reporting of climate change impacts on the health sector.\nSource: Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action 2023 Reporting\nVulnerable populations are disproportionately affected by climate-related health hazards.\nCCRVAs have also been used to identify how various demographic groups will be impacted differently by climate related health hazards. Across Europe, there is increasing recognition that the impacts of climate change will not be felt equally. Vulnerable populations, including older adults, children, people living with disabilities, medical pre-conditions, or in poverty will experience the impacts of climate change differently than members of society that live without health challenges and have access to the tools and resources required to adapt to climate related impacts. Vulnerable populations are often more exposed to climate change impacts and may lack the necessary resources to adequately respond to or mitigate climate-related risks.\nThis approach enables policy makers to develop targeted strategies to protect vulnerable populations from climate related hazards and public health risks. Some of the key actions taken to protect populations from climate driven health risks include the implementation of surveillance and early warning systems, community outreach and sensitization towards climate related hazards, improved public infrastructure, including blue-green infrastructure to address urban flood and heat risks, public water fountains, and the introduction of cooling centers.\nCountries across Europe are taking proactive steps to address climate change impacts on the health sector.\nEuropean countries are planning and implementing adaptation measures that take into consideration the impacts of climate change on human health.\nThe countries, for example Croatia , Cyprus , Czechia , Denmark , Germany or Portugal , report on cooperation through working groups, commissions and other governance structures bringing public authorities and other stakeholders working on health and climate change together and aiming at greater policy integration.\nIn countries such as Ireland , Finland, and Sweden , sectoral health adaptation plans have been developed. Moreover, in Austria and Bulgaria , climate-related topics have been integrated into the curriculum and continuing education of medical care providers, including doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals. The goal of this is to enhance the ability of healthcare professionals to respond to and treat climate related health impacts as well as respond to new and emerging climate related health challenges.\nMany countries, including Austria , Bulgaria , Cyprus , Germany and Poland have implemented programs to enhance public awareness of climate change related health impacts, including how to improve personal preparedness at home. Several countries have also implemented monitoring and early warning systems to alert the public, employers, as well as the health sector of potential climate change related impacts and emergencies. Early warning systems are designed to alert authorities of flood risk, extreme temperatures, allergens, or the presents of pathogens or infectious diseases to enable time for a proactive response. In some jurisdictions, early warning systems inform when to open cooling centres, evacuate people living in flood zones, or close recreational bathing spots due to the presence of bacteria. \u00a0\u00a0\nCountry reporting includes examples of actions taken to address various climate risks to health in residential, workplace and healthcare settings\nThe most frequently listed examples of actions are focused on managing the health risks from high temperatures and monitoring the infectious (particularly vector-borne) diseases, followed by addressing flood-related health issues.\nIn Germany , integration of climate change risks to health is ongoing in occupational health and safety provisions.\u00a0 In Finland , provisions on factors relating to residential building temperature conditions that are affected by the changing climate are laid on. In Austria , Guideline Heat Action Plan supports medical and care facilities in developing and establishing their own heat plans.\nThe countries include examples of adaptation plans with focus on health at the sub-national level, for example in Italy , Poland , Portugal , or Romania .\nFurther information\nMore information is available through climate and health country profile .\nLanguage preference detected\nDo you want to see the page translated into ?
