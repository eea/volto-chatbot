It \nfocuses on the current political priorities and aspirations of the EC, as well as \nproviding an overview of the environment and climate legislation previously \nagreed under the European Green Deal (EGD).\n Chapter 3 Europes environment and climate: state and outlook assesses the \ncurrent state of the environment and climate in Europe including an assessment \nof past trends, outlooks and progress towards policy targets. The assessment is \nstructured around three blocks of content: ecosystems and biodiversity, climate \nchange mitigation and adaptation, and pollution and environmental health.\n Chapter 4 Managing the dynamic between our economy and our natural \nresources explores competing priorities for natural resources in Europe with \na focus on land, water and raw materials, and how these are foundational \nfor a resilient economy and society. It also assesses progress towards a \ncircular economy in which EU resource consumption is decoupled from \neconomic\u00a0growth.\n Chapter 5 Delivering on peoples needs: Europes production and consumption \nsystems explores Europes key production and consumption systems  food, \nenergy, mobility, the built environment and industry  in terms of progress \nmade in transforming these systems towards sustainability and in relation to \nremaining challenges. This is illustrated through a range of examples from \nacross EEA member countries.\n Chapter 6 A cause for hope: levers of transformative change considers a \nrange of levers for change  policy levers, socio-technological levels and \neconomic levers  and demonstrates how initiatives and actions successfully \napplied across EEA member countries can enable and accelerate progress \ntowards sustainability. Aspects covered are the role of policy implementation \nand coherence; innovation; finance; skills and jobs; and governance.\n\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n8\nExecutive summary\nEuropeans face turbulent times. Multiple economic, social, geopolitical and \nenvironmental crises are converging to pose systemic risks to our way of life. Europe \nis warming twice as fast as the global average, with extreme weather events driven \nby climate change impacting peoples lives across Europe today. At the same time, \npolitical realities across the world have undergone a seismic shift, and Russians war \nof aggression against Ukraine and other armed conflicts have focused minds and \ninvestments on defence and security.\nThe European Union (EU) has responded to this volatile and insecure global context \nthrough its strategic policy framework to 2029  the Competitiveness Compass. \nThe three areas for action set out in the compass  innovation, decarbonisation and \nsecurity  all have strong environment and climate dimensions, with clean industry,\nenergy system transformation, circular economy and reducing import dependencies \nas key priorities.\nIndeed, Europe is critically dependent on natural resources for economic security, \nto which climate change and environmental degradation pose a direct threat. \nProtecting our natural resources, mitigating and adapting to climate change, and \nreducing pollution will build the resilience of vital societal functions that depend \non nature, such as food security, drinking water and flood defences. The European \nPreparedness Union Strategy recognises the potential for risks to cascade between \nthe natural, social and political domains in the context of extreme weather events, \nhuman-induced disasters and geopolitical crises. Europe must stay on course with its \ngreen ambitions and implement the environment and climate policies agreed under \nthe European Green Deal (EGD) to achieve its long-term vision of living well within the \nlimits of our planet.\nIn this context, Europes environment 2025 provides the most comprehensive \npicture of the environment, climate and sustainability available in Europe, building \non data from across 38 countries. Figure ES.1 summarises the results of this \ncomprehensive\u00a0assessment.\nOverall, important progress is taking place within climate change mitigation, while \nthere is mixed progress around reducing pollution and transitioning towards the \ncircular economy. The greatest challenges exist around reducing biodiversity loss and \necosystem degradation, as well as adapting to accelerating climate change. However, \nprogress on a range of factors that enable the shift towards sustainability\u00a0\u00a0such as \ninnovation, green employment and sustainable finance - gives cause for\u00a0hope.\nThis executive summary unpacks these key trends and highlights insights from \nacross the three products in Europes environment 2025; the 35 thematic briefings; \nthe 38 country profiles; and this report.\nBiodiversity is declining across terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems \nin Europe due to persistent pressures driven by unsustainable production and \nconsumption patterns, most notably the food system. Key pressures include \nchanges in land and sea use, the over-exploitation of natural resources, pollution and \ninvasive alien species, as well as the increasingly severe impacts of climate change.\n\nExecutive summary  \n9\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nMore than 80% of protected habitats are in a poor or bad state, with 60-70% of soils \ndegraded. In terms of past trends, the 2020 target of the EU Biodiversity Strategy \n\u00a0to halt and reverse biodiversity loss  was not achieved. Figure ES.1 shows \ndeteriorating past trends or a mixed picture across thematic areas.\nOn a positive note, the extent of protected areas increased over the past decade.\n\n...\n\nsecurity by lowering dependence on imported fossil fuels and increasing the \nshare of domestically produced renewable energy. It also shows how effective \npolicy implementation can drive change and deliver measurable progress towards \nsustainability and achieving climate neutrality by 2050.\n\nExecutive summary  \n10\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nProgress on climate change mitigation is reflected in Figure ES.1. The past trend \nshows an improving picture and projected reductions put the EU on track to meet its \n2030 goal of reducing net GHG emissions by at least 55% compared to 1990 levels.\nThe EUs carbon sink related to land use, land use change and forestry has declined \nby about 30% compared to the last decade. This is due to a combination of factors \nsuch as ageing forests, more frequent and widespread tree felling, and the increasing \nimpacts of climate change and severe natural disturbances, including forest fires, \ndroughts and pests.\nA wide variety of options exist to reverse this trend and enhance carbon removals \nin terrestrial ecosystems, with significant environmental and societal co-benefits. \nAdequate finance and improved monitoring will be key to enabling land practitioners \nto adopt changes in their management practices.\nIn the energy system, all EU Member States have successfully reduced their \nreliance on fossil fuels and shifted towards more sustainable energy sources over \nthe last decade, while increased energy efficiency has also brought down demand. \nIn 2023, renewable energy sources represented over 24% of the EUs final energy use. \nThis represents a historic high driven by EU policies to speed up the clean energy \ntransition, including the European Climate Law, the Fit for 55 EU policy package and \nthe REPowerEU plan.\nNevertheless, fossil fuels remain the dominant source of energy  making up almost \n70% of EU gross available energy use in 2023. Further investment is needed to \naccelerate the deployment of renewables and enable a deeper transformation of the \nEuropean energy system.\nClear regulatory signals reinforced with consistent pricing can make low-carbon \nand circular choices cheaper, with the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies crucial \nto\u00a0decarbonisation.\nThere has also been progress in the EUs industrial system, where GHG emissions \nfell by more than 35% from 2005 to 2023. Further decarbonisation will require \nlarge-scale electrification, a switch to hydrogen for certain industrial processes and \nthe substitution of fossil fuel-based materials with renewable materials.\nCuts in air emissions from industry have been driven by decades of pollution control \nlegislation, as well as decarbonisation measures. Nevertheless, industry remains a\n\n...\n\nthe\u00a0EU-27.\nWeather- and climate-related extremes caused economic losses of assets estimated \nat EUR2023 738 billion in the 27 Member States of the EU over the period 1980-2023, \nwith over EUR2023 162 billion in costs from 2021 to 2023 alone.\nAs climate change accelerates the costs are growing, with the average annual \neconomic losses associated with weather- and climate-related extremes in \nthe 2020-2023 period being 2.5 times as high as in the preceding decade from \n2010\u00a0to\u00a02019. At the same time, the insurance protection gap across Europe is \nsubstantial  with most countries reporting over 50% of losses as uninsured. The \ngap has also been widening over time, as uninsured losses have grown at a faster \nrate than insured\u00a0losses.\nChanging growing conditions and extreme weather events, particularly reduced \nwater availability and quality, present risks to Europes food security, with southern \nEurope particularly hard hit. In 2022 and 2023, severe drought in parts of Europe \nled to considerable agricultural losses that translated into higher food prices \nfor\u00a0consumers.\nLooking forward, there is an urgent need for Europes agricultural sector to adapt to \nextreme weather events to guarantee the EUs long-term food security. There is a role \nfor biodiversity in providing solutions for adaptation to changing climatic conditions \nfor food production in Europe, for example as a source of drought-resistant species.\nThe increasing frequency and magnitude of climate-related disasters, as well as \nthe knowledge that the climate will continue to change even with the EUs ambitious \nmitigation efforts, underscores the urgent need to adapt European society and \nthe economy, while at the same time ensuring that no one is left behind. Socially \nvulnerable groups, such as older people, children, low-income groups and people with \ndisabilities, are disproportionately burdened by climate change and do not always \nbenefit fairly from adaptation responses.\nAction is needed to ensure that choices taken today are fit for the future climate, for \nexample in areas like land-use planning and long-lived infrastructure. It is essential to \nidentify the assets at risk from climate-driven extreme weather events and develop \n\nExecutive summary  \n12\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nstrategies that will build social resilience to climate change. Currently, around 12% of \nthe European population lives in flood-prone areas, while 11% of healthcare facilities \nand nearly 15% of industrial facilities in Europe are sited in such areas.\n\n...\n\nprovide a clear pathway towards sustainability, with the focus now falling on \nimplementing legislation agreed under the EGD in an effective and timely manner. \nLocal and regional authorities are playing a critical role in implementing \nenvironment and climate legislation and translating policies into change on the \nground. Transforming the EUs production and consumption systems requires \ncoordinated policies and action across multiple levels of governance. Across Europe, \ncommunities are increasingly taking action to become sustainable, with examples of \ngood practice seen across the food, energy and housing sectors, as well as climate \nchange adaptation.\nEfforts to restore habitats through nature-based solutions will, over time, build \nresilience in natural systems and enable both adaptation to and mitigation of \nclimate change. The Nature Restoration Regulation aims to restore at least 20% of \nthe EU's land and sea areas by 2030; in particular those with the most potential to \ncapture and store carbon and to prevent and reduce the impact of natural disasters.\n\nExecutive summary  \n14\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nHealthy ecosystems help stabilise the climate at the global scale and build resilience \nat the local scale. Forests, wetlands, peatlands and oceans act as carbon sinks \nhelping mitigate climate change and regulate the Earths temperature. Wetlands \nand floodplains provide natural flood protection, forests and urban green spaces \nhelp mitigate the effects of heatwaves and healthy soils enhance water retention, \nreducing the risks of droughts and avalanches.\nIncreasing circularity and decarbonising production have the potential to reduce our \ndependencies on imports of energy and materials and therefore enhance Europes \nstrategic autonomy. By investing in the digital and green transition of European \nindustry, Europe can become a global leader and a first mover in developing \ntechnologies to decarbonise hard-to-abate industries, in particular steel and cement.\nThe EU has set the goal of bolstering the rapid deployment of technological \ninnovations to gain competitive advantage. Indeed, Europe is already a world leader \nin green innovation, with the EU and other European countries already account \nfor almost 27% of cleantech international patent families from 2017 to 2021. \nWeaknesses in the innovation ecosystem and a fragmented Single Market currently \npresent obstacles to commercialisation, however. Despite the challenges, Europe is \nbuilding the foundation for the supply of clean and green sustainable products, as \nwell as stimulating demand and fostering lead markets. \nThis approach forms a key tenet of Europes economic strategy \u00a0competitiveness\u00a0 \nas well as supporting sustainable prosperity that rests on a high-quality environment\n\n...\n\nSoil resources Climate risks to society Global impacts from EU \nconsumption\nBiodiversity investment needs Climate action financing Transformative innovation\nGovernance of climate change \nmitigation and adaptation\nGreen employment\nGreen taxation and other \neconomic instruments\nJustice in sustainability \ntransitions\nFinancing the transition \ntowards sustainable activities\nImproving trends dominate Trends show mixed picture Deteriorating trends dominate\nPast trends (10-15 years)\n\nExecutive summary  \n17\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nBiodiversity and ecosystems Climate change Environment and human health Circular economy and other \nenablers of transformative \nchange\nState of Europe's biodiversity Greenhouse gas emissions Emissions of pollutants to air Circular design and sustainable \nproduction\nPollution of ecosystems Trends in the mobility system Air pollution and impacts on \nhuman health\nWaste generation and material \nconsumption\nProtected areas Trends in the energy system Environmental noise and \nimpacts on human health\nWaste recycling\nWater and climate impacts Carbon dioxide removal from \nthe atmosphere\nWater pollution and human \nhealth\nCircular use of materials\nEcosystems and climate \nimpacts\nOzone-depleting substances \nand fluorinated greenhouse \ngases\nChemical pollution and human \nhealth\nCircular economy financing and \nstrategies\nLand use and land take Climate risks to the economy Environmental health \ninequalities related to air \npollution\nBenefits of a circular economy\nSoil resources Climate risks to society Global impacts from EU \nconsumption\nBiodiversity investment needs Climate action financing Transformative innovation\nGovernance of climate change \nmitigation and adaptation\nGreen employment\nGreen taxation and other \neconomic instruments\nJustice in sustainability \ntransitions\nFinancing the transition \ntowards sustainable activities\nImproving trends expected\nto dominate\nTrends expected to show\na mixed picture\nDeteriorating trends expected\nto dominate\nOutlook (10-15 years)\n(b) Outlook\nThe assessment of outlooks asks what the trends are expected to be 10 to 15 years \nin the future, up to between 2035 and 2040.\nLike the assessment of past trends, the outlook is qualitative and combines modelled \nestimates of future developments (where available) with expert consideration of \nthe likely effects of policies currently in place.

These include Russias invasion of \nUkraine, hikes in the costs of living and a new political leadership in the United States \n(US) that is re-evaluating alliances and disrupting long-standing trade policies. At\u00a0the \nKey messages\n Todays global, geopolitical landscape is characterised by multiple \ncrises. In response, Europe is focused on security and defence, as well \nas boosting competitiveness, to deliver sustainable prosperity and \nmaintain quality of life for European citizens. \n Without environmental resilience, we cannot have long-lasting security. \nA broad understanding of security captures not only defence, but also \nthe resilience of vital societal functions that depend on our natural \nenvironment. Healthy and functional ecosystems underpin food and \nwater security and build resilience to our changing climate. A circular \neconomy and shifting away from fossil fuels help Europe to reduce \ndependency on imports of raw materials and energy. \n Climate change and pollution impact the lives of Europeans today. \nFrom 1980 to 2023, over 240,000 fatalities have been caused by \nweather- and climate-related extreme events in the EU-27, with more \nthan EUR  730 billion in economic losses. Pollution drives death and \ndisease, with air pollution costing the EU EUR 600 billion annually in \nhealth costs and other damages, equal to 4% of GDP .  \n Environmental degradation and climate change threaten Europe's \neconomy. Climate change presents a systemic risk to both the\n\n...\n\nAt the same time, progress on over one-third has stalled or \neven\u00a0regressed.\nSDG progress has also been challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic, escalating conflicts, \ngeopolitical tensions and growing climate impacts. The sobering conclusion is that \nwithout massive investment and scaled-up action, it will be extremely hard to achieve \nthe\u00a0SDGs.\n2.2\t The\tEuropean\tGreen\tDeal\nUnder EC President Ursula von der Leyens first mandate, from 2019 to 2024, the \nlegislative agenda was shaped by the aspirations of the European Green Deal (EGD). \nThis ambitious policy package aims to set the EU on the path to becoming the first \nclimate-neutral continent by 2050, with resource use decoupled from economic \ngrowth, and no person and no place left behind. It aims to protect, conserve and \nenhance the EU's natural environment, and protect the health and well-being of \ncitizens in the face of environment-related risks and impacts. At the same time, it \naims to ensure that the transition is just and inclusive.\nAcknowledging the severity and urgency of climate change and environmental \ndegradation, the EGD reflects the paradigm shift called for by the EEA in its SOER \n2020 report(16) by setting out to transform key systems in the European economy. \nThis ambition reaches beyond sectoral approaches to mainstream sustainability \n\nThe evolving European policy framework\n49\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nacross all policy areas and transform Europes core production and consumption \nsystems (Figure 2.2). Building on the EGD, the 8th Environment Action Programme \n(8th EAP) establishes a framework for action on environment and climate policy up \nto 2030, setting objectives for 2030 and the long-term 2050 objective of living well \nwithin planetary boundaries.\nIn the context of the ECs new mandate, the Political Guidelines for 2024 to 2029 \nemphasise the ongoing importance of delivering on the legislative commitments \nagreed-upon under the EGD and of staying the course on its goals. This section \nprovides an overview of legislative developments in the environment and climate \npolicy landscape under the EGD.\nSource: EC(17).\nFigure 2.2 Strategies under the European Green Deal\nTransforming the \nEU's economy for a \nsustainable future\nThe EU as a \nglobal leader\nA European\nClimate Pact\nMobilising research\nand fostering innovation\nIncreasing the EU's Climate\nambition for 2030 and 2050\nSupplying clean, affordable\nand secure energy\nA zero pollution ambition\nfor a toxic-free environment\n\n...\n\nTo accelerate the shift to sustainable mobility in Europe, revisions to the EU ETS \naim to help reduce emissions from aviation, while the new EU ETS 2 will cover road \ntransport. Under the Fit for 55 policy package, the EU has adopted the regulation on \nCO2 emission performance standards. It sets binding targets, notably for a 100% \nreduction in emissions from new cars and vans by 2035 along with regulations on \nshipping and aviation. In addition, the emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles set \nby Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 were revised and the amendments to the regulation \nentered into force on 26 June 2024.\nAdapting to climate change\nEnsuring that Europe can adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change is \na cross-cutting theme in the EGD. The EU Adaptation Strategy, adopted in 2021, \naims to make adaptation smarter, swifter and more systemic; it also aims to step \nup international action on adaptation to climate change. This should primarily be \nachieved through improved national adaptation strategies and plans. In 2024 the EC \nresponded to the EEAs European Climate Risk Assessment(18) with a communication \non managing climate risks. The Communication identified key principles for climate \nresilience, including:\n Avoiding maladaptation to ensure that resilience measures do not shift risks onto \nothers or worsen future risks;\n Systemic action involving cross-sectoral solutions to address interlinked climate \nrisks; and\n Transformational change to ensure that adaptation is ambitious, inclusive, and \ndoes not lead to social and economic disparities.\nAdditionally, the EU has increased funding to support people and regions \naffected by increasingly frequent climate events through the EU Solidarity Fund, \nNextGenerationEU and the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.\n\nThe evolving European policy framework\n51\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nZero pollution and a circular economy\nTo deliver on the ambition for a zero-pollution ambition for a toxic-free environment, \nthe Zero Pollution Action Plan was adopted in 2021, establishing targets to speed \nup pollution reduction at source. Under this umbrella, the revised urban wastewater \ntreatment directive, ambitious new rules for ambient air quality and the Euro 7 \nregulation have all been adopted, while new rules have been agreed on toy safety and \non detergents and surfactants.\nProgress was made on reducing microplastic pollution; restrictions on microplastics \nbeing added to products have been adopted and a proposal has been made to \nintroduce further measures to prevent pellet losses in the environment.\nThe ECs Chemical Strategy for Sustainability sets out the goal to better protect\n\n...\n\nof failure to implement EU environmental laws through air and water pollution, \nnature degradation and waste are estimated at EUR 180 billion per year for the EU; \napproximately 1% of EU GDP . Effective and full implementation of environmental \npolicies could cut these costs, while ensuring a level playing field for companies \nacross the EU single market(24).\nA recent report from the ECs Joint Research Centre provides a comprehensive \nassessment of progress towards 154 binding and non-binding policy targets set out \nunder the EGD. Targets cover key sectors, including climate, energy, circular economy, \ntransport, agriculture and food, ecosystems and biodiversity, water, soil and air \npollution. There has been progress on 62% of targets and 21% are well on track. As \nof mid-2024, 32 of the 154 targets are currently on track, 64 fall into the acceleration \nneeded category and 15 are found to be not progressing or regressing. For 43 of \nthe targets, no data are currently available(25).\n\nThe evolving European policy framework\n54\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n2.4\t The\tEUs\tglobal\trole\taround\tthe\tenvironment\tand\tclimate\nThe EUs ambitious climate targets and high environmental standards have made \nEurope a credible leader and advocate for increased ambition globally. On the \ninternational stage, the EU has been active in securing multi-national agreements that \nprovide the foundation for global action on climate change and biodiversity loss. The \nEU has led the way on climate change, contributed to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) processes and played a key role in \nsecuring the Paris Agreement. The EU was also a driver of the Kunming-Montreal \nGlobal Biodiversity Framework(26). Furthermore, it is involved in ongoing negotiations \nto develop a global agreement on plastics pollution(27).\nBox 2.5\nThe Paris Agreement and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework\nThe Paris Agreement (2015)\nThe Paris Agreement, adopted under the UNFCCC, is a cornerstone of global climate \naction. It aims to:\n limit global temperature rise to well below 2\u00b0C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C; \n enhance resilience and strengthen adaptation to climate impacts and reduce \nvulnerabilities; and \n mobilise public and private investments in support of low-emission, \nclimate-resilient\u00a0pathways. \nThe agreement requires countries to submit and update Nationally-Determined \nContributions (NDCs) every 5 years to ensure progress and ambition. The EU submitted\n\n...\n\nAt the same time, the EC will propose \nfurther amendments to the CBAM regulation to extend the scope to further downstream \nproducts and introduce additional anti-circumvention measures.\nIn parallel, the EU continues to further support the decarbonisation efforts of partner \ncountries through technical assistance and regulatory cooperation. For example, the \nInternational Carbon Markets and Carbon Pricing Diplomacy Task Force supports partner \ncountries in developing effective carbon pricing policies and robust approaches to \ninternational carbon markets.\nThe carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will apply from 2026 and aims to \nprevent carbon leakage by ensuring that the carbon price of imports is equivalent to \nthe carbon price of domestic production (see Box 2.6).\n\n\n\n57\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n3 Europes environment and climate: state and\u00a0outlook\nKey messages\n Europe is the fastest-warming continent in the world and its climate \nis changing at an alarming rate, threatening security, public health, \necosystems, infrastructure and the economy. Over 240,000 people \ndied because of weather- and climate-related extreme events from \n1980 to 2023 in the EU-27. Weather- and climate-related extremes \ncaused economic losses estimated at EUR2023 738 billion in the EU-27 \nfrom 1980 to 2023, with over EUR2023 162 billion in costs from 2021 to \n2023 alone. The insurance protection gap across Europe is substantial, \nwith most countries reporting over 50% of losses as\u00a0uninsured.\n Managing the climate crisis requires a dual approach: increasing \nresilience and mitigating climate change. Europe must accelerate \nits implementation of adaptation measures to avoid future costs \nand consequences linked to climate change. At the same time, it \nmust continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase \ncarbon\u00a0removals.\n Europe is a world leader in mitigating climate change. The EU has \nsuccessfully cut net domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 37% \nsince 1990, due to reductions in fossil fuel use and doubling the share \nof renewables since 2005. This provides a model for how climate \naction can boost competitiveness and energy security by lowering \ndependency on imported fossil fuels and increasing the share of \ndomestically produced renewable energy.\n Biodiversity is in poor condition across terrestrial, freshwater and \nmarine ecosystems in Europe due to persistent pressures from \nproduction and consumption systems, most notably the food system. \nOverall, 81% of protected habitats are in a poor or bad state, 60-70% of \nsoils are degraded and 62% of water bodies are not in good ecological \nstatus. Past policy targets have not been met and it is unlikely that\n\n...\n\nquarter of total energy use, \nstrengthening Europe's\nenergy independence\nThe EU is largely on track\n to meet the agreed targets \nfor 2030 if full implementation \nof policies is ensured\nAll European \nMember States\nhave dedicated\nadaptation policies \nin place\nDeployment of \nclean technologies\nis decarbonising Europe \nwhile increasing \ncompetitiveness\u00a0\nand resilience\nEU successfully \nphased out \nozone-depleting\nsubstances\n\n\nEuropes environment and climate: state and outlook \n77\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nWhat is the EU doing?\nThe EU is addressing climate risks through both climate change mitigation and \nadaptation strategies. The EUs legal framework, established under the European \nClimate Law(91), sets a binding target to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 at the \nlatest, with the interim target of reducing net GHG emissions by at least 55% by \n2030 compared to 1990 levels. These targets are reinforced by a robust policy \nand legal framework, including binding GHG emission reduction and removal \ntargets for Member States (with the effort sharing regulation (ESR) and land use, \nland use change and forestry (LULUCF) regulation), the European-wide emissions \ntrading system (ETS), a detailed climate and energy governance framework and a \ncomprehensive set of supplementary legislation addressing diverse sectors, many of \nwhich are established as part of the Fit for 55 package.\nAt the same time, the European Climate Law acknowledges that, while critical, \nmitigation alone is not enough. Adaptation is recognised as a key component of \nEuropes long-term global response to climate change and requires Member States \nand the EU to enhance their adaptive capacity, strengthen their resilience and reduce \ntheir vulnerability to climate change. The ECs 2024 communication on managing \nclimate risks sets out a vision for stepping up action to improve our societal and \neconomic resilience and preparedness in the face of climatic conditions that have \nalready changed(92). The EU Preparedness Union Strategy aims to prevent and react \nto emerging threats and crises, including climate change among the growing security \nchallenges. Further, the EU Climate Adaptation Plan is currently in preparation, due \nto be published in late 2026. This plan is expected to outline specific measures to \nprepare for and address the already inevitable impacts of climate change.\nThe global dimension\nClimate change is a global problem, requiring global action on both mitigation and \nadaptation. Europe accounts for 6% of current global emissions and, in contrast \nto the declining GHG emissions in the EU, global GHG emissions are still on the\nrise, increasing by more than 60% since 1990(93). Within the framework of the Paris \nAgreement, the parties to the UNFCCC have set the target of limiting the global \ntemperature rise this century to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and to \npursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5\u00b0C. As global \nemissions continue to increase despite efforts in Europe, the global community \nmust\u00a0step up its climate action to reduce GHG emissions.\nThe Paris Agreement also established the global goal of enhancing adaptive capacity, \nstrengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change, with a view \nto contributing to sustainable development and ensuring an adequate adaptation \nresponse. To guide the achievement of the global goal, a framework of targets \nwas initiated by the UNFCCC parties (the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Framework \nfor Global Climate Resilience) and a 2-year UAEBel\u00e9m work programme on the \ndevelopment of indicators to measure the progress achieved towards those targets \nhas been ongoing since 2023(94).\nWhat is the current state at the European level?\nTable 3.2 compiles past trend assessments over the last 10 to 15 years, outlooks \n10 to 15 years ahead, and assessments of the prospects of meeting 2030 and \n2050 EU policy targets (where in place) from the nine thematic briefings related to \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation. Details on the assessments, as well as on \ncross-cutting drivers and pressures, are provided in Sections 3.2.2 to 3.2.4.\n\nEuropes environment and climate: state and outlook \n78\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nTable 3.2 Overview of assessment results on climate change\nImproving trends (are expected \nto) dominate/largely on track to \nmeet policy targets\nTrends (are expected to) show a \nmixed picture/partially on track \nto meet targets/highly uncertain\nNo specific policy targets\nDeteriorating trends (are expected \nto) dominate/Largely not on track \nto meet policy targets\nSource: Climate change briefings of Europes environment 2025.\nBriefing Greenhouse \ngas \nemissions \n(net)\nTrends \nin the \nmobility \nsystem\nTrends \nin the \nenergy \nsystem\nCarbon \ndioxide \nremoval \nfrom the \natmosphere\nOzone-\ndepleting \nsubstances \nand \nfluorinated \ngreenhouse \ngases\nClimate \nrisks to the \neconomy\nClimate \nrisks to \nsociety\nClimate \naction \nfinancing\nGovernance \nof climate \nchange \nmitigation \nand \nadaptation\nPast trends \n(10-15 years)\n     \nOutlook  \n(10-15 years)\n      \nProspects \nof meeting \nEU policy \ntargets for \n2030\n    \nProspects \nof meeting \nEU policy \ntargets for \n2050\n    \n3.2.2 Past trends\n\n...\n\n81\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\ncontext, the EU has made considerable progress in understanding the climate risks it \nis facing and preparing for them.\nThe EU Preparedness Union Strategy aims at enhanced climate adaptation and \nsecuring the availability of critical natural resources such as water. This is to be \nachieved through an integrated approach that focusses on multiple (climatic \nand non-climatic) hazards simultaneously, brings together all relevant actors \nacross all levels of government (local, regional, national, and EU), and brings \ntogether citizens, local communities, civil society, businesses, social partners and \nacademic\u00a0communities.\nNational climate risk assessments are increasingly used to inform the development \nof adaptation policy(24). All EU Member States have a national adaptation policy in \nplace; many also have regional or sectoral adaptation policies or action plans(101). \nIn 2024, 24 out of the 38 EEA member countries had legislative provisions \nfor adaptation; 18 countries had a standalone climate law, with an adaptation \ncomponent(102). The number of sub-regional authorities with adaptation plans in place \nhas also increased substantially over the past decade. For example, since April 2025, \nover 5,956 local authorities have been committed to action on adaptation under the \nEU Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy initiative(103).\nEU legislation, such as the floods directive or the water reuse regulation, have \nensured that some of the risks under climate change, such as floods and droughts, \nare addressed consistently across countries. At the same time, looking at other \nincreasingly pressing risks, only 21 out of the 38 EEA member countries have \nheat-health action plans in place setting out governance protocols and procedures \nto address the risks of extreme temperatures to human lives(104) and drought \nmanagement is regulated by legislation in only 19 EU Member States(105).\nThus, societal preparedness for weather extremes and other climate impacts is still \nlow; whilst appropriate governance structures and policies exist (Table 3.2), actual \nimplementation of measures is lagging substantially behind the rapidly increasing \nrisk levels(24). The extent to which we can avoid damages will largely depend on how \nquickly we can reduce global GHG emissions, and how quickly and effectively we can \nprepare our societies and adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change(24).\nIn summary, to address the climate crisis effectively, Europe must accelerate both \nits mitigation and adaptation efforts. This requires urgent and decisive action at all\nlevels  global, national and local  to reduce vulnerabilities, enhance resilience and \nfacilitate transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy.\n3.2.3 Outlook and prospects for meeting policy targets\nAs the EU progresses towards climate neutrality, significant strides have been made \nin both mitigation and adaptation. However, challenges remain: the pace and scale of \naction need to accelerate to meet key targets.\nClimate change mitigation\nThe accelerated emission reductions witnessed over the past decades are expected \nto continue in the years ahead, and in their regular progress reporting, Member States \nare demonstrating growing ambition levels. Collectively, Member States project \nthat their current and planned additional policies and measures will deliver net GHG \nemission reductions converging towards the 2030 target of net 55 %. \n\nEuropes environment and climate: state and outlook \n82\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nMember States have finalised their updated National Energy and Climate Plans \n(NECPs) and integrated further Fit for 55 legislation. Together, they demonstrate how \nMember States collectively anticipate approaching the 2030 climate target of a net \n55% reduction. In the crucial years remaining to 2030, implementation of an array \nof EU and national policies and measures will be critical. This will require significant \ninvestment, with a need for public as well as private funding to be scaled up.\nBeyond 2030, the European Climate Law requires that a new emission reduction \ntarget is set for 2040 to put the EU on course for climate neutrality by 2050. The \nEuropean Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC) recommends EU \nemission reductions of 90-95% by 2040, relative to 1990 levels, in a science-based \nassessment that takes into account both fairness and feasibility(106).\nWith its proposed amendment to the European Climate Law in July 2025, the \nEuropean Commission (EC) echoed this scientific recommendation, proposing an \nadditional interim target of reducing the EUs net GHG emissions by 90% by 2040 \nrelative to 1990, based on an impact assessment(107).\nReducing net emissions by 90% by 2040 would put the EU on course towards climate \nneutrality by 2050. This would ensure predictability for citizens, businesses and \ninvestors by making sure that resources invested now and in the coming decades are \ncompatible with the EUs pathway to climate neutrality, avoiding wasted investments \nin the fossil fuel economy. At the same time, it would boost the competitiveness of \nEuropes businesses, create stable and future-proof jobs, enable the EU to lead the\n\n...\n\nkey\u00a0components.\nClimate change risks and adaptation\nWhilst the governance of climate change (the distribution of responsibilities and \npolicy development at the EU, national and subnational levels) offers reasons for \noptimism for future resilience to the climate crisis, the pace and scale of adaptation \nactions needs to increase. If Europe does not implement the solutions identified, it \nis still not adequately prepared to address the risks posed by climate change and \nthe societal and economic losses will remain or increase in the near future. Climate \nchange is projected to increase economic costs across Europe significantly, driven \nby more frequent and intense extremes and slow-onset impacts, with some regions \nfacing particularly high risks due to cascading and compounding effects(24). There is \nan urgent need to mainstream and upscale climate adaptation across sectors and \ngovernance levels to address the growing risks from extreme heat, drought, wildfires \nand flooding(24).\nThe current lack of measurable adaptation policy targets (cf. no targets under \nclimate risks to the economy and society in Table 3.2) and associated indicators \nmakes it difficult to assess the progress made and the future prospects. The \n\nEuropes environment and climate: state and outlook \n85\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nongoing development of the EUs Climate Adaptation Plan offers hope for a more \nlegislative-\u00a0and target-led approach to adaptation in the future.\nThe 2021 EUs Adaptation Strategy, promoting smarter, faster and more systemic \nadaptation, has called for the use of nature-based solutions for climate adaptation \nand disaster risk reduction. Applied at scale, such solutions could also enhance \nbiodiversity in urban and rural landscapes, with such measures foreseen under most \nurban adaptation plans in Europe(103). The EUs Adaptation Strategy also promotes a \nwider use of drought management plans, measures to increase the water retention \ncapacity of soils and safe water reuse.\nIn this context, the water reuse regulation, applied from 2023, can contribute to \nadaptations designed to cope with more frequent and severe droughts. Expanding \nand replicating local initiatives, in combination with infrastructural and institutional \nmeasures, will be necessary to build resilience across Europe(110). The 2024 EC \ncommunication on managing climate risks firmly states that the ultimate goal of \nadaptation actions is to protect people and prosperity.\nYet other aspects emphasised in the EUs Adaptation Strategy, the 2024 EC \ncommunication on managing climate risks and the 2025 EU Preparedness Union \nStrategy  such as the focus on vulnerable groups and achieving just resilience\n\n...\n\nHowever, governance-related challenges \nare a persistent barrier to the implementation of adaptation actions in many \ncountries, even where well-developed governance frameworks are in place. These \nchallenges include difficulties in coordination due to financial, technical and \nhuman\u00a0limitations(112).\nAnother key barrier to the development and implementation of further adaptation \nsolutions relates to difficulty comparing adaptation versus inaction scenarios. EU \nefforts in Destination Earth (a highly-accurate digital model of the Earth \u00a0a\u00a0digital \ntwin  to model, monitor and simulate natural phenomena, hazards and the \nrelated human activities) offers a potential avenue for modelling the impacts of \nfuture\u00a0solutions.\nConsidering strained national budgets will remain, EU funds will continue to play \na major role in financing adaptation action for most Member States. Yet, whilst \nthe EU budget is on track to exceed its climate change mitigation and adaptation \nspending target of 30% between 2021 and 2027, the money invested in adaptation \nis not earmarked as such, resulting in an information gap on the actual spending. \nSome countries also report dedicated national adaptation funds to finance the \nimplementation of national or sectoral adaptation actions. However, it is very unclear \nto what extent the actions planned in the national adaptation plans have been \nimplemented, as countries are obliged to report on policies rather than measures.\nMeeting climate change mitigation and adaptation targets requires a concerted \neffort across all levels of governance. The EUs approach to climate action\u00a0\u00a0from \nits ambitious emission reduction targets to its increasing focus on climate \nresilience\u00a0\u00a0provides a strong framework for the future. However, achieving these \ngoals will require not only continued investment but also a commitment to equity, \nfairness and integration across sectors. As the EU works towards a carbon-neutral \nand climate-resilient future, the need for urgent and coordinated action has never \nbeen more\u00a0critical.\n3.2.4 Drivers and pressures\nTo address both climate adaptation and climate mitigation, it is essential to understand \nhow various sectors are not only impacted by climate change but also contribute to \nGHG emissions. Climate change affects key economic sectors in Europe\u00a0\u00a0agriculture/\nfood, forestry, energy, the built environment and transport/mobility\u00a0\u00a0while these same \nsectors also drive emissions that contribute to the climate crisis. In other words, the \neffects of climate change mitigation and adaptation are interconnected and have a \ndual impact on the different sectors in\u00a0society.\nClimate-related risks to sectors\nThe EU Member States and Iceland, Switzerland and T\u00fcrkiye most often report on \nagriculture, health biodiversity, and forestry as the key sectors affected by climate \nchange (Figure 3.5).\n\n...\n\npossible trade-offs from climate policies such as the burning \nof\u00a0biomass. \nHg and PAHs from burning coal for energy production widely pollute \nEuropes surface waters(15).\nTable 3.4 Pollution drivers and pressures by sector (cont.)\n\n\n\n113\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n4  Managing the dynamic between our economy \nand\u00a0our natural resources\nKey messages\n Europes economy is largely dependent on natural resources, in many \ncases imported from outside Europe. Environmental pressures from \nresource extraction, along with geopolitical instability, make it vital to \nrethink how we source and consume natural resources. \n The EU is one of the most intensively used land masses on the \nglobe, with 38.8% of land dedicated to agriculture, 35.3% to forests, \nand 5.8% to residential and urban areas. As such, there is a need \nto consider trade-offs across competing demands for land for \nbiomass production, carbon sequestration, renewable energy and \necosystem\u00a0restoration. \n Water pollution, over-abstraction and physical changes impact \nwater bodies, groundwater and wetlands, with climate change \nexacerbating these issues. Deterioration in water quality creates risks \nfor production-consumption systems, especially food, industry and \nenergy. Water stress affects 30% of Europe's territory and 34% of the \npopulation each year. This is likely to increase in the future due to \nclimate change. \n Raw materials feed Europe's industrial economy and sustain our \nhigh quality of life. Our food, housing and mobility systems together \naccount for more than 80% of the EUs total material footprint. \nDecarbonisation and electrification are driving demand for critical raw \nmaterials, for which the EU is heavily dependent on imports from a \nlimited number of non-European countries. \n Only 11.8% of all material demand in the EU is sourced from recycling, \nand the EU is still far from its ambition to double its circularity rate \nby 2030. Yet, circularity practices and business models, along with \npolicies to address high levels of consumption, can lower resource \nuse and reduce waste while reducing the EUs dependence on \nmaterial\u00a0imports. \n There is an urgent need to reduce material consumption within the \nEU, which is unsustainable and much higher than in most other \nworld regions. International supply chains mean that much of the \nenvironmental degradation driven by the extraction, processing \nand use of resources to fuel EU consumption occurs outside the \nEU. Efforts to reduce the EUs material footprint should address the \ndemand for resources along the entire value chain.\n\n...\n\nalign with public concerns by making these dimensions equal to economic concerns \nin high-level decision-making(162).\n\nA cause for hope: levers of transformative change\n228\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n6.4\t Securing\tEuropes\tnatural\twealth\tto\tdeliver\thealthy\tand\tprosperous\tlives\nOnly by mitigating and adapting to climate change and protecting and restoring \necosystems will we be able to maintain the high quality of life of European citizens. \nResponsible stewardship of our natural capital can ensure that we can meet peoples \nneeds today, while also maintaining and restoring Europes natural resources \nfor future generations. This entails recognising that these resources provide the \nfoundation for a prosperous, competitive, resilient and secure Europe in the future.\nClimate change is a serious threat already wreaking havoc today, with urgent action \nneeded to protect people from the impacts of droughts, floods, extreme heat and \nother climate impacts. Nature plays a key role in increasing resilience to climate \nchange in Europe, especially through nature-based solutions. Sustainable solutions \noffer a 'triple win' by:\n mitigating environmental pollution and supporting biodiversity;\n improving the health and well-being of populations; and\n fostering social cohesion and integration.\nDecarbonising the EU economy and embracing circularity will reduce the EUs \ndependence on imported energy and raw materials, and increase our strategic \nautonomy and security. This is also foreseen to create new jobs and reinforce the \nEUs position as a first leader on sustainability.\nLooking forward, the strategic goal of a sustainable dynamic between Europes \neconomy and the environment must be rooted in meeting peoples needs. To \nmaintain European living standards, it will be crucial to adopt a holistic view of \nprosperity that goes beyond competitiveness.

Multiple economic, social, geopolitical and \nenvironmental crises are converging to pose systemic risks to our way of life. Europe \nis warming twice as fast as the global average, with extreme weather events driven \nby climate change impacting peoples lives across Europe today. At the same time, \npolitical realities across the world have undergone a seismic shift, and Russians war \nof aggression against Ukraine and other armed conflicts have focused minds and \ninvestments on defence and security.\nThe European Union (EU) has responded to this volatile and insecure global context \nthrough its strategic policy framework to 2029  the Competitiveness Compass. \nThe three areas for action set out in the compass  innovation, decarbonisation and \nsecurity  all have strong environment and climate dimensions, with clean industry,\nenergy system transformation, circular economy and reducing import dependencies \nas key priorities.\nIndeed, Europe is critically dependent on natural resources for economic security, \nto which climate change and environmental degradation pose a direct threat. \nProtecting our natural resources, mitigating and adapting to climate change, and \nreducing pollution will build the resilience of vital societal functions that depend \non nature, such as food security, drinking water and flood defences. The European \nPreparedness Union Strategy recognises the potential for risks to cascade between \nthe natural, social and political domains in the context of extreme weather events, \nhuman-induced disasters and geopolitical crises. Europe must stay on course with its \ngreen ambitions and implement the environment and climate policies agreed under \nthe European Green Deal (EGD) to achieve its long-term vision of living well within the \nlimits of our planet.\nIn this context, Europes environment 2025 provides the most comprehensive \npicture of the environment, climate and sustainability available in Europe, building \non data from across 38 countries. Figure ES.1 summarises the results of this \ncomprehensive\u00a0assessment.\nOverall, important progress is taking place within climate change mitigation, while \nthere is mixed progress around reducing pollution and transitioning towards the \ncircular economy. The greatest challenges exist around reducing biodiversity loss and \necosystem degradation, as well as adapting to accelerating climate change. However, \nprogress on a range of factors that enable the shift towards sustainability\u00a0\u00a0such as \ninnovation, green employment and sustainable finance - gives cause for\u00a0hope.\nThis executive summary unpacks these key trends and highlights insights from \nacross the three products in Europes environment 2025; the 35 thematic briefings; \nthe 38 country profiles; and this report.\nBiodiversity is declining across terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems \nin Europe due to persistent pressures driven by unsustainable production and \nconsumption patterns, most notably the food system. Key pressures include \nchanges in land and sea use, the over-exploitation of natural resources, pollution and \ninvasive alien species, as well as the increasingly severe impacts of climate change.\n\nExecutive summary  \n9\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nMore than 80% of protected habitats are in a poor or bad state, with 60-70% of soils \ndegraded. In terms of past trends, the 2020 target of the EU Biodiversity Strategy \n\u00a0to halt and reverse biodiversity loss  was not achieved. Figure ES.1 shows \ndeteriorating past trends or a mixed picture across thematic areas.\nOn a positive note, the extent of protected areas increased over the past decade.\n\n...\n\nsecurity by lowering dependence on imported fossil fuels and increasing the \nshare of domestically produced renewable energy. It also shows how effective \npolicy implementation can drive change and deliver measurable progress towards \nsustainability and achieving climate neutrality by 2050.\n\nExecutive summary  \n10\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nProgress on climate change mitigation is reflected in Figure ES.1. The past trend \nshows an improving picture and projected reductions put the EU on track to meet its \n2030 goal of reducing net GHG emissions by at least 55% compared to 1990 levels.\nThe EUs carbon sink related to land use, land use change and forestry has declined \nby about 30% compared to the last decade. This is due to a combination of factors \nsuch as ageing forests, more frequent and widespread tree felling, and the increasing \nimpacts of climate change and severe natural disturbances, including forest fires, \ndroughts and pests.\nA wide variety of options exist to reverse this trend and enhance carbon removals \nin terrestrial ecosystems, with significant environmental and societal co-benefits. \nAdequate finance and improved monitoring will be key to enabling land practitioners \nto adopt changes in their management practices.\nIn the energy system, all EU Member States have successfully reduced their \nreliance on fossil fuels and shifted towards more sustainable energy sources over \nthe last decade, while increased energy efficiency has also brought down demand. \nIn 2023, renewable energy sources represented over 24% of the EUs final energy use. \nThis represents a historic high driven by EU policies to speed up the clean energy \ntransition, including the European Climate Law, the Fit for 55 EU policy package and \nthe REPowerEU plan.\nNevertheless, fossil fuels remain the dominant source of energy  making up almost \n70% of EU gross available energy use in 2023. Further investment is needed to \naccelerate the deployment of renewables and enable a deeper transformation of the \nEuropean energy system.\nClear regulatory signals reinforced with consistent pricing can make low-carbon \nand circular choices cheaper, with the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies crucial \nto\u00a0decarbonisation.\nThere has also been progress in the EUs industrial system, where GHG emissions \nfell by more than 35% from 2005 to 2023. Further decarbonisation will require \nlarge-scale electrification, a switch to hydrogen for certain industrial processes and \nthe substitution of fossil fuel-based materials with renewable materials.\nCuts in air emissions from industry have been driven by decades of pollution control \nlegislation, as well as decarbonisation measures. Nevertheless, industry remains a\n\n...\n\nthe\u00a0EU-27.\nWeather- and climate-related extremes caused economic losses of assets estimated \nat EUR2023 738 billion in the 27 Member States of the EU over the period 1980-2023, \nwith over EUR2023 162 billion in costs from 2021 to 2023 alone.\nAs climate change accelerates the costs are growing, with the average annual \neconomic losses associated with weather- and climate-related extremes in \nthe 2020-2023 period being 2.5 times as high as in the preceding decade from \n2010\u00a0to\u00a02019. At the same time, the insurance protection gap across Europe is \nsubstantial  with most countries reporting over 50% of losses as uninsured. The \ngap has also been widening over time, as uninsured losses have grown at a faster \nrate than insured\u00a0losses.\nChanging growing conditions and extreme weather events, particularly reduced \nwater availability and quality, present risks to Europes food security, with southern \nEurope particularly hard hit. In 2022 and 2023, severe drought in parts of Europe \nled to considerable agricultural losses that translated into higher food prices \nfor\u00a0consumers.\nLooking forward, there is an urgent need for Europes agricultural sector to adapt to \nextreme weather events to guarantee the EUs long-term food security. There is a role \nfor biodiversity in providing solutions for adaptation to changing climatic conditions \nfor food production in Europe, for example as a source of drought-resistant species.\nThe increasing frequency and magnitude of climate-related disasters, as well as \nthe knowledge that the climate will continue to change even with the EUs ambitious \nmitigation efforts, underscores the urgent need to adapt European society and \nthe economy, while at the same time ensuring that no one is left behind. Socially \nvulnerable groups, such as older people, children, low-income groups and people with \ndisabilities, are disproportionately burdened by climate change and do not always \nbenefit fairly from adaptation responses.\nAction is needed to ensure that choices taken today are fit for the future climate, for \nexample in areas like land-use planning and long-lived infrastructure. It is essential to \nidentify the assets at risk from climate-driven extreme weather events and develop \n\nExecutive summary  \n12\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nstrategies that will build social resilience to climate change. Currently, around 12% of \nthe European population lives in flood-prone areas, while 11% of healthcare facilities \nand nearly 15% of industrial facilities in Europe are sited in such areas.\n\n...\n\nprovide a clear pathway towards sustainability, with the focus now falling on \nimplementing legislation agreed under the EGD in an effective and timely manner. \nLocal and regional authorities are playing a critical role in implementing \nenvironment and climate legislation and translating policies into change on the \nground. Transforming the EUs production and consumption systems requires \ncoordinated policies and action across multiple levels of governance. Across Europe, \ncommunities are increasingly taking action to become sustainable, with examples of \ngood practice seen across the food, energy and housing sectors, as well as climate \nchange adaptation.\nEfforts to restore habitats through nature-based solutions will, over time, build \nresilience in natural systems and enable both adaptation to and mitigation of \nclimate change. The Nature Restoration Regulation aims to restore at least 20% of \nthe EU's land and sea areas by 2030; in particular those with the most potential to \ncapture and store carbon and to prevent and reduce the impact of natural disasters.\n\nExecutive summary  \n14\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nHealthy ecosystems help stabilise the climate at the global scale and build resilience \nat the local scale. Forests, wetlands, peatlands and oceans act as carbon sinks \nhelping mitigate climate change and regulate the Earths temperature. Wetlands \nand floodplains provide natural flood protection, forests and urban green spaces \nhelp mitigate the effects of heatwaves and healthy soils enhance water retention, \nreducing the risks of droughts and avalanches.\nIncreasing circularity and decarbonising production have the potential to reduce our \ndependencies on imports of energy and materials and therefore enhance Europes \nstrategic autonomy. By investing in the digital and green transition of European \nindustry, Europe can become a global leader and a first mover in developing \ntechnologies to decarbonise hard-to-abate industries, in particular steel and cement.\nThe EU has set the goal of bolstering the rapid deployment of technological \ninnovations to gain competitive advantage. Indeed, Europe is already a world leader \nin green innovation, with the EU and other European countries already account \nfor almost 27% of cleantech international patent families from 2017 to 2021. \nWeaknesses in the innovation ecosystem and a fragmented Single Market currently \npresent obstacles to commercialisation, however. Despite the challenges, Europe is \nbuilding the foundation for the supply of clean and green sustainable products, as \nwell as stimulating demand and fostering lead markets. \nThis approach forms a key tenet of Europes economic strategy \u00a0competitiveness\u00a0 \nas well as supporting sustainable prosperity that rests on a high-quality environment\n\n...\n\nSoil resources Climate risks to society Global impacts from EU \nconsumption\nBiodiversity investment needs Climate action financing Transformative innovation\nGovernance of climate change \nmitigation and adaptation\nGreen employment\nGreen taxation and other \neconomic instruments\nJustice in sustainability \ntransitions\nFinancing the transition \ntowards sustainable activities\nImproving trends dominate Trends show mixed picture Deteriorating trends dominate\nPast trends (10-15 years)\n\nExecutive summary  \n17\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nBiodiversity and ecosystems Climate change Environment and human health Circular economy and other \nenablers of transformative \nchange\nState of Europe's biodiversity Greenhouse gas emissions Emissions of pollutants to air Circular design and sustainable \nproduction\nPollution of ecosystems Trends in the mobility system Air pollution and impacts on \nhuman health\nWaste generation and material \nconsumption\nProtected areas Trends in the energy system Environmental noise and \nimpacts on human health\nWaste recycling\nWater and climate impacts Carbon dioxide removal from \nthe atmosphere\nWater pollution and human \nhealth\nCircular use of materials\nEcosystems and climate \nimpacts\nOzone-depleting substances \nand fluorinated greenhouse \ngases\nChemical pollution and human \nhealth\nCircular economy financing and \nstrategies\nLand use and land take Climate risks to the economy Environmental health \ninequalities related to air \npollution\nBenefits of a circular economy\nSoil resources Climate risks to society Global impacts from EU \nconsumption\nBiodiversity investment needs Climate action financing Transformative innovation\nGovernance of climate change \nmitigation and adaptation\nGreen employment\nGreen taxation and other \neconomic instruments\nJustice in sustainability \ntransitions\nFinancing the transition \ntowards sustainable activities\nImproving trends expected\nto dominate\nTrends expected to show\na mixed picture\nDeteriorating trends expected\nto dominate\nOutlook (10-15 years)\n(b) Outlook\nThe assessment of outlooks asks what the trends are expected to be 10 to 15 years \nin the future, up to between 2035 and 2040.\nLike the assessment of past trends, the outlook is qualitative and combines modelled \nestimates of future developments (where available) with expert consideration of \nthe likely effects of policies currently in place.

These include Russias invasion of \nUkraine, hikes in the costs of living and a new political leadership in the United States \n(US) that is re-evaluating alliances and disrupting long-standing trade policies. At\u00a0the \nKey messages\n Todays global, geopolitical landscape is characterised by multiple \ncrises. In response, Europe is focused on security and defence, as well \nas boosting competitiveness, to deliver sustainable prosperity and \nmaintain quality of life for European citizens. \n Without environmental resilience, we cannot have long-lasting security. \nA broad understanding of security captures not only defence, but also \nthe resilience of vital societal functions that depend on our natural \nenvironment. Healthy and functional ecosystems underpin food and \nwater security and build resilience to our changing climate. A circular \neconomy and shifting away from fossil fuels help Europe to reduce \ndependency on imports of raw materials and energy. \n Climate change and pollution impact the lives of Europeans today. \nFrom 1980 to 2023, over 240,000 fatalities have been caused by \nweather- and climate-related extreme events in the EU-27, with more \nthan EUR  730 billion in economic losses. Pollution drives death and \ndisease, with air pollution costing the EU EUR 600 billion annually in \nhealth costs and other damages, equal to 4% of GDP .  \n Environmental degradation and climate change threaten Europe's \neconomy. Climate change presents a systemic risk to both the\n\n...\n\nAt the same time, progress on over one-third has stalled or \neven\u00a0regressed.\nSDG progress has also been challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic, escalating conflicts, \ngeopolitical tensions and growing climate impacts. The sobering conclusion is that \nwithout massive investment and scaled-up action, it will be extremely hard to achieve \nthe\u00a0SDGs.\n2.2\t The\tEuropean\tGreen\tDeal\nUnder EC President Ursula von der Leyens first mandate, from 2019 to 2024, the \nlegislative agenda was shaped by the aspirations of the European Green Deal (EGD). \nThis ambitious policy package aims to set the EU on the path to becoming the first \nclimate-neutral continent by 2050, with resource use decoupled from economic \ngrowth, and no person and no place left behind. It aims to protect, conserve and \nenhance the EU's natural environment, and protect the health and well-being of \ncitizens in the face of environment-related risks and impacts. At the same time, it \naims to ensure that the transition is just and inclusive.\nAcknowledging the severity and urgency of climate change and environmental \ndegradation, the EGD reflects the paradigm shift called for by the EEA in its SOER \n2020 report(16) by setting out to transform key systems in the European economy. \nThis ambition reaches beyond sectoral approaches to mainstream sustainability \n\nThe evolving European policy framework\n49\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nacross all policy areas and transform Europes core production and consumption \nsystems (Figure 2.2). Building on the EGD, the 8th Environment Action Programme \n(8th EAP) establishes a framework for action on environment and climate policy up \nto 2030, setting objectives for 2030 and the long-term 2050 objective of living well \nwithin planetary boundaries.\nIn the context of the ECs new mandate, the Political Guidelines for 2024 to 2029 \nemphasise the ongoing importance of delivering on the legislative commitments \nagreed-upon under the EGD and of staying the course on its goals. This section \nprovides an overview of legislative developments in the environment and climate \npolicy landscape under the EGD.\nSource: EC(17).\nFigure 2.2 Strategies under the European Green Deal\nTransforming the \nEU's economy for a \nsustainable future\nThe EU as a \nglobal leader\nA European\nClimate Pact\nMobilising research\nand fostering innovation\nIncreasing the EU's Climate\nambition for 2030 and 2050\nSupplying clean, affordable\nand secure energy\nA zero pollution ambition\nfor a toxic-free environment\n\n...\n\nTo accelerate the shift to sustainable mobility in Europe, revisions to the EU ETS \naim to help reduce emissions from aviation, while the new EU ETS 2 will cover road \ntransport. Under the Fit for 55 policy package, the EU has adopted the regulation on \nCO2 emission performance standards. It sets binding targets, notably for a 100% \nreduction in emissions from new cars and vans by 2035 along with regulations on \nshipping and aviation. In addition, the emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles set \nby Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 were revised and the amendments to the regulation \nentered into force on 26 June 2024.\nAdapting to climate change\nEnsuring that Europe can adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change is \na cross-cutting theme in the EGD. The EU Adaptation Strategy, adopted in 2021, \naims to make adaptation smarter, swifter and more systemic; it also aims to step \nup international action on adaptation to climate change. This should primarily be \nachieved through improved national adaptation strategies and plans. In 2024 the EC \nresponded to the EEAs European Climate Risk Assessment(18) with a communication \non managing climate risks. The Communication identified key principles for climate \nresilience, including:\n Avoiding maladaptation to ensure that resilience measures do not shift risks onto \nothers or worsen future risks;\n Systemic action involving cross-sectoral solutions to address interlinked climate \nrisks; and\n Transformational change to ensure that adaptation is ambitious, inclusive, and \ndoes not lead to social and economic disparities.\nAdditionally, the EU has increased funding to support people and regions \naffected by increasingly frequent climate events through the EU Solidarity Fund, \nNextGenerationEU and the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.\n\nThe evolving European policy framework\n51\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nZero pollution and a circular economy\nTo deliver on the ambition for a zero-pollution ambition for a toxic-free environment, \nthe Zero Pollution Action Plan was adopted in 2021, establishing targets to speed \nup pollution reduction at source. Under this umbrella, the revised urban wastewater \ntreatment directive, ambitious new rules for ambient air quality and the Euro 7 \nregulation have all been adopted, while new rules have been agreed on toy safety and \non detergents and surfactants.\nProgress was made on reducing microplastic pollution; restrictions on microplastics \nbeing added to products have been adopted and a proposal has been made to \nintroduce further measures to prevent pellet losses in the environment.\nThe ECs Chemical Strategy for Sustainability sets out the goal to better protect\n\n...\n\nof failure to implement EU environmental laws through air and water pollution, \nnature degradation and waste are estimated at EUR 180 billion per year for the EU; \napproximately 1% of EU GDP . Effective and full implementation of environmental \npolicies could cut these costs, while ensuring a level playing field for companies \nacross the EU single market(24).\nA recent report from the ECs Joint Research Centre provides a comprehensive \nassessment of progress towards 154 binding and non-binding policy targets set out \nunder the EGD. Targets cover key sectors, including climate, energy, circular economy, \ntransport, agriculture and food, ecosystems and biodiversity, water, soil and air \npollution. There has been progress on 62% of targets and 21% are well on track. As \nof mid-2024, 32 of the 154 targets are currently on track, 64 fall into the acceleration \nneeded category and 15 are found to be not progressing or regressing. For 43 of \nthe targets, no data are currently available(25).\n\nThe evolving European policy framework\n54\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n2.4\t The\tEUs\tglobal\trole\taround\tthe\tenvironment\tand\tclimate\nThe EUs ambitious climate targets and high environmental standards have made \nEurope a credible leader and advocate for increased ambition globally. On the \ninternational stage, the EU has been active in securing multi-national agreements that \nprovide the foundation for global action on climate change and biodiversity loss. The \nEU has led the way on climate change, contributed to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) processes and played a key role in \nsecuring the Paris Agreement. The EU was also a driver of the Kunming-Montreal \nGlobal Biodiversity Framework(26). Furthermore, it is involved in ongoing negotiations \nto develop a global agreement on plastics pollution(27).\nBox 2.5\nThe Paris Agreement and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework\nThe Paris Agreement (2015)\nThe Paris Agreement, adopted under the UNFCCC, is a cornerstone of global climate \naction. It aims to:\n limit global temperature rise to well below 2\u00b0C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C; \n enhance resilience and strengthen adaptation to climate impacts and reduce \nvulnerabilities; and \n mobilise public and private investments in support of low-emission, \nclimate-resilient\u00a0pathways. \nThe agreement requires countries to submit and update Nationally-Determined \nContributions (NDCs) every 5 years to ensure progress and ambition. The EU submitted\n\n...\n\nAt the same time, the EC will propose \nfurther amendments to the CBAM regulation to extend the scope to further downstream \nproducts and introduce additional anti-circumvention measures.\nIn parallel, the EU continues to further support the decarbonisation efforts of partner \ncountries through technical assistance and regulatory cooperation. For example, the \nInternational Carbon Markets and Carbon Pricing Diplomacy Task Force supports partner \ncountries in developing effective carbon pricing policies and robust approaches to \ninternational carbon markets.\nThe carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will apply from 2026 and aims to \nprevent carbon leakage by ensuring that the carbon price of imports is equivalent to \nthe carbon price of domestic production (see Box 2.6).\n\n\n\n57\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n3 Europes environment and climate: state and\u00a0outlook\nKey messages\n Europe is the fastest-warming continent in the world and its climate \nis changing at an alarming rate, threatening security, public health, \necosystems, infrastructure and the economy. Over 240,000 people \ndied because of weather- and climate-related extreme events from \n1980 to 2023 in the EU-27. Weather- and climate-related extremes \ncaused economic losses estimated at EUR2023 738 billion in the EU-27 \nfrom 1980 to 2023, with over EUR2023 162 billion in costs from 2021 to \n2023 alone. The insurance protection gap across Europe is substantial, \nwith most countries reporting over 50% of losses as\u00a0uninsured.\n Managing the climate crisis requires a dual approach: increasing \nresilience and mitigating climate change. Europe must accelerate \nits implementation of adaptation measures to avoid future costs \nand consequences linked to climate change. At the same time, it \nmust continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase \ncarbon\u00a0removals.\n Europe is a world leader in mitigating climate change. The EU has \nsuccessfully cut net domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 37% \nsince 1990, due to reductions in fossil fuel use and doubling the share \nof renewables since 2005. This provides a model for how climate \naction can boost competitiveness and energy security by lowering \ndependency on imported fossil fuels and increasing the share of \ndomestically produced renewable energy.\n Biodiversity is in poor condition across terrestrial, freshwater and \nmarine ecosystems in Europe due to persistent pressures from \nproduction and consumption systems, most notably the food system. \nOverall, 81% of protected habitats are in a poor or bad state, 60-70% of \nsoils are degraded and 62% of water bodies are not in good ecological \nstatus. Past policy targets have not been met and it is unlikely that\n\n...\n\nquarter of total energy use, \nstrengthening Europe's\nenergy independence\nThe EU is largely on track\n to meet the agreed targets \nfor 2030 if full implementation \nof policies is ensured\nAll European \nMember States\nhave dedicated\nadaptation policies \nin place\nDeployment of \nclean technologies\nis decarbonising Europe \nwhile increasing \ncompetitiveness\u00a0\nand resilience\nEU successfully \nphased out \nozone-depleting\nsubstances\n\n\nEuropes environment and climate: state and outlook \n77\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nWhat is the EU doing?\nThe EU is addressing climate risks through both climate change mitigation and \nadaptation strategies. The EUs legal framework, established under the European \nClimate Law(91), sets a binding target to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 at the \nlatest, with the interim target of reducing net GHG emissions by at least 55% by \n2030 compared to 1990 levels. These targets are reinforced by a robust policy \nand legal framework, including binding GHG emission reduction and removal \ntargets for Member States (with the effort sharing regulation (ESR) and land use, \nland use change and forestry (LULUCF) regulation), the European-wide emissions \ntrading system (ETS), a detailed climate and energy governance framework and a \ncomprehensive set of supplementary legislation addressing diverse sectors, many of \nwhich are established as part of the Fit for 55 package.\nAt the same time, the European Climate Law acknowledges that, while critical, \nmitigation alone is not enough. Adaptation is recognised as a key component of \nEuropes long-term global response to climate change and requires Member States \nand the EU to enhance their adaptive capacity, strengthen their resilience and reduce \ntheir vulnerability to climate change. The ECs 2024 communication on managing \nclimate risks sets out a vision for stepping up action to improve our societal and \neconomic resilience and preparedness in the face of climatic conditions that have \nalready changed(92). The EU Preparedness Union Strategy aims to prevent and react \nto emerging threats and crises, including climate change among the growing security \nchallenges. Further, the EU Climate Adaptation Plan is currently in preparation, due \nto be published in late 2026. This plan is expected to outline specific measures to \nprepare for and address the already inevitable impacts of climate change.\nThe global dimension\nClimate change is a global problem, requiring global action on both mitigation and \nadaptation. Europe accounts for 6% of current global emissions and, in contrast \nto the declining GHG emissions in the EU, global GHG emissions are still on the\nrise, increasing by more than 60% since 1990(93). Within the framework of the Paris \nAgreement, the parties to the UNFCCC have set the target of limiting the global \ntemperature rise this century to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and to \npursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5\u00b0C. As global \nemissions continue to increase despite efforts in Europe, the global community \nmust\u00a0step up its climate action to reduce GHG emissions.\nThe Paris Agreement also established the global goal of enhancing adaptive capacity, \nstrengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change, with a view \nto contributing to sustainable development and ensuring an adequate adaptation \nresponse. To guide the achievement of the global goal, a framework of targets \nwas initiated by the UNFCCC parties (the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Framework \nfor Global Climate Resilience) and a 2-year UAEBel\u00e9m work programme on the \ndevelopment of indicators to measure the progress achieved towards those targets \nhas been ongoing since 2023(94).\nWhat is the current state at the European level?\nTable 3.2 compiles past trend assessments over the last 10 to 15 years, outlooks \n10 to 15 years ahead, and assessments of the prospects of meeting 2030 and \n2050 EU policy targets (where in place) from the nine thematic briefings related to \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation. Details on the assessments, as well as on \ncross-cutting drivers and pressures, are provided in Sections 3.2.2 to 3.2.4.\n\nEuropes environment and climate: state and outlook \n78\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nTable 3.2 Overview of assessment results on climate change\nImproving trends (are expected \nto) dominate/largely on track to \nmeet policy targets\nTrends (are expected to) show a \nmixed picture/partially on track \nto meet targets/highly uncertain\nNo specific policy targets\nDeteriorating trends (are expected \nto) dominate/Largely not on track \nto meet policy targets\nSource: Climate change briefings of Europes environment 2025.\nBriefing Greenhouse \ngas \nemissions \n(net)\nTrends \nin the \nmobility \nsystem\nTrends \nin the \nenergy \nsystem\nCarbon \ndioxide \nremoval \nfrom the \natmosphere\nOzone-\ndepleting \nsubstances \nand \nfluorinated \ngreenhouse \ngases\nClimate \nrisks to the \neconomy\nClimate \nrisks to \nsociety\nClimate \naction \nfinancing\nGovernance \nof climate \nchange \nmitigation \nand \nadaptation\nPast trends \n(10-15 years)\n     \nOutlook  \n(10-15 years)\n      \nProspects \nof meeting \nEU policy \ntargets for \n2030\n    \nProspects \nof meeting \nEU policy \ntargets for \n2050\n    \n3.2.2 Past trends\n\n...\n\n81\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\ncontext, the EU has made considerable progress in understanding the climate risks it \nis facing and preparing for them.\nThe EU Preparedness Union Strategy aims at enhanced climate adaptation and \nsecuring the availability of critical natural resources such as water. This is to be \nachieved through an integrated approach that focusses on multiple (climatic \nand non-climatic) hazards simultaneously, brings together all relevant actors \nacross all levels of government (local, regional, national, and EU), and brings \ntogether citizens, local communities, civil society, businesses, social partners and \nacademic\u00a0communities.\nNational climate risk assessments are increasingly used to inform the development \nof adaptation policy(24). All EU Member States have a national adaptation policy in \nplace; many also have regional or sectoral adaptation policies or action plans(101). \nIn 2024, 24 out of the 38 EEA member countries had legislative provisions \nfor adaptation; 18 countries had a standalone climate law, with an adaptation \ncomponent(102). The number of sub-regional authorities with adaptation plans in place \nhas also increased substantially over the past decade. For example, since April 2025, \nover 5,956 local authorities have been committed to action on adaptation under the \nEU Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy initiative(103).\nEU legislation, such as the floods directive or the water reuse regulation, have \nensured that some of the risks under climate change, such as floods and droughts, \nare addressed consistently across countries. At the same time, looking at other \nincreasingly pressing risks, only 21 out of the 38 EEA member countries have \nheat-health action plans in place setting out governance protocols and procedures \nto address the risks of extreme temperatures to human lives(104) and drought \nmanagement is regulated by legislation in only 19 EU Member States(105).\nThus, societal preparedness for weather extremes and other climate impacts is still \nlow; whilst appropriate governance structures and policies exist (Table 3.2), actual \nimplementation of measures is lagging substantially behind the rapidly increasing \nrisk levels(24). The extent to which we can avoid damages will largely depend on how \nquickly we can reduce global GHG emissions, and how quickly and effectively we can \nprepare our societies and adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change(24).\nIn summary, to address the climate crisis effectively, Europe must accelerate both \nits mitigation and adaptation efforts. This requires urgent and decisive action at all\nlevels  global, national and local  to reduce vulnerabilities, enhance resilience and \nfacilitate transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy.\n3.2.3 Outlook and prospects for meeting policy targets\nAs the EU progresses towards climate neutrality, significant strides have been made \nin both mitigation and adaptation. However, challenges remain: the pace and scale of \naction need to accelerate to meet key targets.\nClimate change mitigation\nThe accelerated emission reductions witnessed over the past decades are expected \nto continue in the years ahead, and in their regular progress reporting, Member States \nare demonstrating growing ambition levels. Collectively, Member States project \nthat their current and planned additional policies and measures will deliver net GHG \nemission reductions converging towards the 2030 target of net 55 %. \n\nEuropes environment and climate: state and outlook \n82\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nMember States have finalised their updated National Energy and Climate Plans \n(NECPs) and integrated further Fit for 55 legislation. Together, they demonstrate how \nMember States collectively anticipate approaching the 2030 climate target of a net \n55% reduction. In the crucial years remaining to 2030, implementation of an array \nof EU and national policies and measures will be critical. This will require significant \ninvestment, with a need for public as well as private funding to be scaled up.\nBeyond 2030, the European Climate Law requires that a new emission reduction \ntarget is set for 2040 to put the EU on course for climate neutrality by 2050. The \nEuropean Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC) recommends EU \nemission reductions of 90-95% by 2040, relative to 1990 levels, in a science-based \nassessment that takes into account both fairness and feasibility(106).\nWith its proposed amendment to the European Climate Law in July 2025, the \nEuropean Commission (EC) echoed this scientific recommendation, proposing an \nadditional interim target of reducing the EUs net GHG emissions by 90% by 2040 \nrelative to 1990, based on an impact assessment(107).\nReducing net emissions by 90% by 2040 would put the EU on course towards climate \nneutrality by 2050. This would ensure predictability for citizens, businesses and \ninvestors by making sure that resources invested now and in the coming decades are \ncompatible with the EUs pathway to climate neutrality, avoiding wasted investments \nin the fossil fuel economy. At the same time, it would boost the competitiveness of \nEuropes businesses, create stable and future-proof jobs, enable the EU to lead the\n\n...\n\nkey\u00a0components.\nClimate change risks and adaptation\nWhilst the governance of climate change (the distribution of responsibilities and \npolicy development at the EU, national and subnational levels) offers reasons for \noptimism for future resilience to the climate crisis, the pace and scale of adaptation \nactions needs to increase. If Europe does not implement the solutions identified, it \nis still not adequately prepared to address the risks posed by climate change and \nthe societal and economic losses will remain or increase in the near future. Climate \nchange is projected to increase economic costs across Europe significantly, driven \nby more frequent and intense extremes and slow-onset impacts, with some regions \nfacing particularly high risks due to cascading and compounding effects(24). There is \nan urgent need to mainstream and upscale climate adaptation across sectors and \ngovernance levels to address the growing risks from extreme heat, drought, wildfires \nand flooding(24).\nThe current lack of measurable adaptation policy targets (cf. no targets under \nclimate risks to the economy and society in Table 3.2) and associated indicators \nmakes it difficult to assess the progress made and the future prospects. The \n\nEuropes environment and climate: state and outlook \n85\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nongoing development of the EUs Climate Adaptation Plan offers hope for a more \nlegislative-\u00a0and target-led approach to adaptation in the future.\nThe 2021 EUs Adaptation Strategy, promoting smarter, faster and more systemic \nadaptation, has called for the use of nature-based solutions for climate adaptation \nand disaster risk reduction. Applied at scale, such solutions could also enhance \nbiodiversity in urban and rural landscapes, with such measures foreseen under most \nurban adaptation plans in Europe(103). The EUs Adaptation Strategy also promotes a \nwider use of drought management plans, measures to increase the water retention \ncapacity of soils and safe water reuse.\nIn this context, the water reuse regulation, applied from 2023, can contribute to \nadaptations designed to cope with more frequent and severe droughts. Expanding \nand replicating local initiatives, in combination with infrastructural and institutional \nmeasures, will be necessary to build resilience across Europe(110). The 2024 EC \ncommunication on managing climate risks firmly states that the ultimate goal of \nadaptation actions is to protect people and prosperity.\nYet other aspects emphasised in the EUs Adaptation Strategy, the 2024 EC \ncommunication on managing climate risks and the 2025 EU Preparedness Union \nStrategy  such as the focus on vulnerable groups and achieving just resilience\n\n...\n\nHowever, governance-related challenges \nare a persistent barrier to the implementation of adaptation actions in many \ncountries, even where well-developed governance frameworks are in place. These \nchallenges include difficulties in coordination due to financial, technical and \nhuman\u00a0limitations(112).\nAnother key barrier to the development and implementation of further adaptation \nsolutions relates to difficulty comparing adaptation versus inaction scenarios. EU \nefforts in Destination Earth (a highly-accurate digital model of the Earth \u00a0a\u00a0digital \ntwin  to model, monitor and simulate natural phenomena, hazards and the \nrelated human activities) offers a potential avenue for modelling the impacts of \nfuture\u00a0solutions.\nConsidering strained national budgets will remain, EU funds will continue to play \na major role in financing adaptation action for most Member States. Yet, whilst \nthe EU budget is on track to exceed its climate change mitigation and adaptation \nspending target of 30% between 2021 and 2027, the money invested in adaptation \nis not earmarked as such, resulting in an information gap on the actual spending. \nSome countries also report dedicated national adaptation funds to finance the \nimplementation of national or sectoral adaptation actions. However, it is very unclear \nto what extent the actions planned in the national adaptation plans have been \nimplemented, as countries are obliged to report on policies rather than measures.\nMeeting climate change mitigation and adaptation targets requires a concerted \neffort across all levels of governance. The EUs approach to climate action\u00a0\u00a0from \nits ambitious emission reduction targets to its increasing focus on climate \nresilience\u00a0\u00a0provides a strong framework for the future. However, achieving these \ngoals will require not only continued investment but also a commitment to equity, \nfairness and integration across sectors. As the EU works towards a carbon-neutral \nand climate-resilient future, the need for urgent and coordinated action has never \nbeen more\u00a0critical.\n3.2.4 Drivers and pressures\nTo address both climate adaptation and climate mitigation, it is essential to understand \nhow various sectors are not only impacted by climate change but also contribute to \nGHG emissions. Climate change affects key economic sectors in Europe\u00a0\u00a0agriculture/\nfood, forestry, energy, the built environment and transport/mobility\u00a0\u00a0while these same \nsectors also drive emissions that contribute to the climate crisis. In other words, the \neffects of climate change mitigation and adaptation are interconnected and have a \ndual impact on the different sectors in\u00a0society.\nClimate-related risks to sectors\nThe EU Member States and Iceland, Switzerland and T\u00fcrkiye most often report on \nagriculture, health biodiversity, and forestry as the key sectors affected by climate \nchange (Figure 3.5).\n\n...\n\npossible trade-offs from climate policies such as the burning \nof\u00a0biomass. \nHg and PAHs from burning coal for energy production widely pollute \nEuropes surface waters(15).\nTable 3.4 Pollution drivers and pressures by sector (cont.)\n\n\n\n113\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n4  Managing the dynamic between our economy \nand\u00a0our natural resources\nKey messages\n Europes economy is largely dependent on natural resources, in many \ncases imported from outside Europe. Environmental pressures from \nresource extraction, along with geopolitical instability, make it vital to \nrethink how we source and consume natural resources. \n The EU is one of the most intensively used land masses on the \nglobe, with 38.8% of land dedicated to agriculture, 35.3% to forests, \nand 5.8% to residential and urban areas. As such, there is a need \nto consider trade-offs across competing demands for land for \nbiomass production, carbon sequestration, renewable energy and \necosystem\u00a0restoration. \n Water pollution, over-abstraction and physical changes impact \nwater bodies, groundwater and wetlands, with climate change \nexacerbating these issues. Deterioration in water quality creates risks \nfor production-consumption systems, especially food, industry and \nenergy. Water stress affects 30% of Europe's territory and 34% of the \npopulation each year. This is likely to increase in the future due to \nclimate change. \n Raw materials feed Europe's industrial economy and sustain our \nhigh quality of life. Our food, housing and mobility systems together \naccount for more than 80% of the EUs total material footprint. \nDecarbonisation and electrification are driving demand for critical raw \nmaterials, for which the EU is heavily dependent on imports from a \nlimited number of non-European countries. \n Only 11.8% of all material demand in the EU is sourced from recycling, \nand the EU is still far from its ambition to double its circularity rate \nby 2030. Yet, circularity practices and business models, along with \npolicies to address high levels of consumption, can lower resource \nuse and reduce waste while reducing the EUs dependence on \nmaterial\u00a0imports. \n There is an urgent need to reduce material consumption within the \nEU, which is unsustainable and much higher than in most other \nworld regions. International supply chains mean that much of the \nenvironmental degradation driven by the extraction, processing \nand use of resources to fuel EU consumption occurs outside the \nEU. Efforts to reduce the EUs material footprint should address the \ndemand for resources along the entire value chain.\n\n...\n\nalign with public concerns by making these dimensions equal to economic concerns \nin high-level decision-making(162).\n\nA cause for hope: levers of transformative change\n228\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n6.4\t Securing\tEuropes\tnatural\twealth\tto\tdeliver\thealthy\tand\tprosperous\tlives\nOnly by mitigating and adapting to climate change and protecting and restoring \necosystems will we be able to maintain the high quality of life of European citizens. \nResponsible stewardship of our natural capital can ensure that we can meet peoples \nneeds today, while also maintaining and restoring Europes natural resources \nfor future generations. This entails recognising that these resources provide the \nfoundation for a prosperous, competitive, resilient and secure Europe in the future.\nClimate change is a serious threat already wreaking havoc today, with urgent action \nneeded to protect people from the impacts of droughts, floods, extreme heat and \nother climate impacts. Nature plays a key role in increasing resilience to climate \nchange in Europe, especially through nature-based solutions. Sustainable solutions \noffer a 'triple win' by:\n mitigating environmental pollution and supporting biodiversity;\n improving the health and well-being of populations; and\n fostering social cohesion and integration.\nDecarbonising the EU economy and embracing circularity will reduce the EUs \ndependence on imported energy and raw materials, and increase our strategic \nautonomy and security. This is also foreseen to create new jobs and reinforce the \nEUs position as a first leader on sustainability.\nLooking forward, the strategic goal of a sustainable dynamic between Europes \neconomy and the environment must be rooted in meeting peoples needs. To \nmaintain European living standards, it will be crucial to adopt a holistic view of \nprosperity that goes beyond competitiveness. Rather, prosperity should encompass \nthe quality of peoples livelihoods, their health and security, as well as long-term \nresilience to climate and environ", "blurb": "quarter of total energy use, \nstrengthening Europe's\nenergy independence\nThe EU is largely on track\n to meet the agreed targets \nfor 2030 if full implementation \nof policies is ensured\nAll European \nMember States\nhave dedicated\nadaptation policies \nin place\nDeployment of \nclean technologies\nis decarbonising Europe \nwhile increasing \ncompetitiveness\u00a0\nand resilience\nEU successfully \nphased out \nozone-depleting\nsubstances\n\n\nEuropes environment and climate: state and outlook \n77\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nWhat is the EU doing?\nThe EU is addressing climate risks through both climate change mitigation and \nadaptation strategies.

Multiple economic, social, geopolitical and \nenvironmental crises are converging to pose systemic risks to our way of life. Europe \nis warming twice as fast as the global average, with extreme weather events driven \nby climate change impacting peoples lives across Europe today. At the same time, \npolitical realities across the world have undergone a seismic shift, and Russians war \nof aggression against Ukraine and other armed conflicts have focused minds and \ninvestments on defence and security.\nThe European Union (EU) has responded to this volatile and insecure global context \nthrough its strategic policy framework to 2029  the Competitiveness Compass. \nThe three areas for action set out in the compass  innovation, decarbonisation and \nsecurity  all have strong environment and climate dimensions, with clean industry,\nenergy system transformation, circular economy and reducing import dependencies \nas key priorities.\nIndeed, Europe is critically dependent on natural resources for economic security, \nto which climate change and environmental degradation pose a direct threat. \nProtecting our natural resources, mitigating and adapting to climate change, and \nreducing pollution will build the resilience of vital societal functions that depend \non nature, such as food security, drinking water and flood defences. The European \nPreparedness Union Strategy recognises the potential for risks to cascade between \nthe natural, social and political domains in the context of extreme weather events, \nhuman-induced disasters and geopolitical crises. Europe must stay on course with its \ngreen ambitions and implement the environment and climate policies agreed under \nthe European Green Deal (EGD) to achieve its long-term vision of living well within the \nlimits of our planet.\nIn this context, Europes environment 2025 provides the most comprehensive \npicture of the environment, climate and sustainability available in Europe, building \non data from across 38 countries. Figure ES.1 summarises the results of this \ncomprehensive\u00a0assessment.\nOverall, important progress is taking place within climate change mitigation, while \nthere is mixed progress around reducing pollution and transitioning towards the \ncircular economy. The greatest challenges exist around reducing biodiversity loss and \necosystem degradation, as well as adapting to accelerating climate change. However, \nprogress on a range of factors that enable the shift towards sustainability\u00a0\u00a0such as \ninnovation, green employment and sustainable finance - gives cause for\u00a0hope.\nThis executive summary unpacks these key trends and highlights insights from \nacross the three products in Europes environment 2025; the 35 thematic briefings; \nthe 38 country profiles; and this report.\nBiodiversity is declining across terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems \nin Europe due to persistent pressures driven by unsustainable production and \nconsumption patterns, most notably the food system. Key pressures include \nchanges in land and sea use, the over-exploitation of natural resources, pollution and \ninvasive alien species, as well as the increasingly severe impacts of climate change.\n\nExecutive summary  \n9\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nMore than 80% of protected habitats are in a poor or bad state, with 60-70% of soils \ndegraded. In terms of past trends, the 2020 target of the EU Biodiversity Strategy \n\u00a0to halt and reverse biodiversity loss  was not achieved. Figure ES.1 shows \ndeteriorating past trends or a mixed picture across thematic areas.\nOn a positive note, the extent of protected areas increased over the past decade.\n\n...\n\nsecurity by lowering dependence on imported fossil fuels and increasing the \nshare of domestically produced renewable energy. It also shows how effective \npolicy implementation can drive change and deliver measurable progress towards \nsustainability and achieving climate neutrality by 2050.\n\nExecutive summary  \n10\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nProgress on climate change mitigation is reflected in Figure ES.1. The past trend \nshows an improving picture and projected reductions put the EU on track to meet its \n2030 goal of reducing net GHG emissions by at least 55% compared to 1990 levels.\nThe EUs carbon sink related to land use, land use change and forestry has declined \nby about 30% compared to the last decade. This is due to a combination of factors \nsuch as ageing forests, more frequent and widespread tree felling, and the increasing \nimpacts of climate change and severe natural disturbances, including forest fires, \ndroughts and pests.\nA wide variety of options exist to reverse this trend and enhance carbon removals \nin terrestrial ecosystems, with significant environmental and societal co-benefits. \nAdequate finance and improved monitoring will be key to enabling land practitioners \nto adopt changes in their management practices.\nIn the energy system, all EU Member States have successfully reduced their \nreliance on fossil fuels and shifted towards more sustainable energy sources over \nthe last decade, while increased energy efficiency has also brought down demand. \nIn 2023, renewable energy sources represented over 24% of the EUs final energy use. \nThis represents a historic high driven by EU policies to speed up the clean energy \ntransition, including the European Climate Law, the Fit for 55 EU policy package and \nthe REPowerEU plan.\nNevertheless, fossil fuels remain the dominant source of energy  making up almost \n70% of EU gross available energy use in 2023. Further investment is needed to \naccelerate the deployment of renewables and enable a deeper transformation of the \nEuropean energy system.\nClear regulatory signals reinforced with consistent pricing can make low-carbon \nand circular choices cheaper, with the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies crucial \nto\u00a0decarbonisation.\nThere has also been progress in the EUs industrial system, where GHG emissions \nfell by more than 35% from 2005 to 2023. Further decarbonisation will require \nlarge-scale electrification, a switch to hydrogen for certain industrial processes and \nthe substitution of fossil fuel-based materials with renewable materials.\nCuts in air emissions from industry have been driven by decades of pollution control \nlegislation, as well as decarbonisation measures. Nevertheless, industry remains a\n\n...\n\nthe\u00a0EU-27.\nWeather- and climate-related extremes caused economic losses of assets estimated \nat EUR2023 738 billion in the 27 Member States of the EU over the period 1980-2023, \nwith over EUR2023 162 billion in costs from 2021 to 2023 alone.\nAs climate change accelerates the costs are growing, with the average annual \neconomic losses associated with weather- and climate-related extremes in \nthe 2020-2023 period being 2.5 times as high as in the preceding decade from \n2010\u00a0to\u00a02019. At the same time, the insurance protection gap across Europe is \nsubstantial  with most countries reporting over 50% of losses as uninsured. The \ngap has also been widening over time, as uninsured losses have grown at a faster \nrate than insured\u00a0losses.\nChanging growing conditions and extreme weather events, particularly reduced \nwater availability and quality, present risks to Europes food security, with southern \nEurope particularly hard hit. In 2022 and 2023, severe drought in parts of Europe \nled to considerable agricultural losses that translated into higher food prices \nfor\u00a0consumers.\nLooking forward, there is an urgent need for Europes agricultural sector to adapt to \nextreme weather events to guarantee the EUs long-term food security. There is a role \nfor biodiversity in providing solutions for adaptation to changing climatic conditions \nfor food production in Europe, for example as a source of drought-resistant species.\nThe increasing frequency and magnitude of climate-related disasters, as well as \nthe knowledge that the climate will continue to change even with the EUs ambitious \nmitigation efforts, underscores the urgent need to adapt European society and \nthe economy, while at the same time ensuring that no one is left behind. Socially \nvulnerable groups, such as older people, children, low-income groups and people with \ndisabilities, are disproportionately burdened by climate change and do not always \nbenefit fairly from adaptation responses.\nAction is needed to ensure that choices taken today are fit for the future climate, for \nexample in areas like land-use planning and long-lived infrastructure. It is essential to \nidentify the assets at risk from climate-driven extreme weather events and develop \n\nExecutive summary  \n12\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nstrategies that will build social resilience to climate change. Currently, around 12% of \nthe European population lives in flood-prone areas, while 11% of healthcare facilities \nand nearly 15% of industrial facilities in Europe are sited in such areas.\n\n...\n\nprovide a clear pathway towards sustainability, with the focus now falling on \nimplementing legislation agreed under the EGD in an effective and timely manner. \nLocal and regional authorities are playing a critical role in implementing \nenvironment and climate legislation and translating policies into change on the \nground. Transforming the EUs production and consumption systems requires \ncoordinated policies and action across multiple levels of governance. Across Europe, \ncommunities are increasingly taking action to become sustainable, with examples of \ngood practice seen across the food, energy and housing sectors, as well as climate \nchange adaptation.\nEfforts to restore habitats through nature-based solutions will, over time, build \nresilience in natural systems and enable both adaptation to and mitigation of \nclimate change. The Nature Restoration Regulation aims to restore at least 20% of \nthe EU's land and sea areas by 2030; in particular those with the most potential to \ncapture and store carbon and to prevent and reduce the impact of natural disasters.\n\nExecutive summary  \n14\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nHealthy ecosystems help stabilise the climate at the global scale and build resilience \nat the local scale. Forests, wetlands, peatlands and oceans act as carbon sinks \nhelping mitigate climate change and regulate the Earths temperature. Wetlands \nand floodplains provide natural flood protection, forests and urban green spaces \nhelp mitigate the effects of heatwaves and healthy soils enhance water retention, \nreducing the risks of droughts and avalanches.\nIncreasing circularity and decarbonising production have the potential to reduce our \ndependencies on imports of energy and materials and therefore enhance Europes \nstrategic autonomy. By investing in the digital and green transition of European \nindustry, Europe can become a global leader and a first mover in developing \ntechnologies to decarbonise hard-to-abate industries, in particular steel and cement.\nThe EU has set the goal of bolstering the rapid deployment of technological \ninnovations to gain competitive advantage.

These include Russias invasion of \nUkraine, hikes in the costs of living and a new political leadership in the United States \n(US) that is re-evaluating alliances and disrupting long-standing trade policies. At\u00a0the \nKey messages\n Todays global, geopolitical landscape is characterised by multiple \ncrises. In response, Europe is focused on security and defence, as well \nas boosting competitiveness, to deliver sustainable prosperity and \nmaintain quality of life for European citizens. \n Without environmental resilience, we cannot have long-lasting security. \nA broad understanding of security captures not only defence, but also \nthe resilience of vital societal functions that depend on our natural \nenvironment. Healthy and functional ecosystems underpin food and \nwater security and build resilience to our changing climate. A circular \neconomy and shifting away from fossil fuels help Europe to reduce \ndependency on imports of raw materials and energy. \n Climate change and pollution impact the lives of Europeans today. \nFrom 1980 to 2023, over 240,000 fatalities have been caused by \nweather- and climate-related extreme events in the EU-27, with more \nthan EUR  730 billion in economic losses. Pollution drives death and \ndisease, with air pollution costing the EU EUR 600 billion annually in \nhealth costs and other damages, equal to 4% of GDP .  \n Environmental degradation and climate change threaten Europe's \neconomy.

The sobering conclusion is that \nwithout massive investment and scaled-up action, it will be extremely hard to achieve \nthe\u00a0SDGs.\n2.2\t The\tEuropean\tGreen\tDeal\nUnder EC President Ursula von der Leyens first mandate, from 2019 to 2024, the \nlegislative agenda was shaped by the aspirations of the European Green Deal (EGD). \nThis ambitious policy package aims to set the EU on the path to becoming the first \nclimate-neutral continent by 2050, with resource use decoupled from economic \ngrowth, and no person and no place left behind. It aims to protect, conserve and \nenhance the EU's natural environment, and protect the health and well-being of \ncitizens in the face of environment-related risks and impacts. At the same time, it \naims to ensure that the transition is just and inclusive.\nAcknowledging the severity and urgency of climate change and environmental \ndegradation, the EGD reflects the paradigm shift called for by the EEA in its SOER \n2020 report(16) by setting out to transform key systems in the European economy. \nThis ambition reaches beyond sectoral approaches to mainstream sustainability \n\nThe evolving European policy framework\n49\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nacross all policy areas and transform Europes core production and consumption \nsystems (Figure 2.2). Building on the EGD, the 8th Environment Action Programme \n(8th EAP) establishes a framework for action on environment and climate policy up \nto 2030, setting objectives for 2030 and the long-term 2050 objective of living well \nwithin planetary boundaries.\nIn the context of the ECs new mandate, the Political Guidelines for 2024 to 2029 \nemphasise the ongoing importance of delivering on the legislative commitments \nagreed-upon under the EGD and of staying the course on its goals. This section \nprovides an overview of legislative developments in the environment and climate \npolicy landscape under the EGD.\nSource: EC(17).\nFigure 2.2 Strategies under the European Green Deal\nTransforming the \nEU's economy for a \nsustainable future\nThe EU as a \nglobal leader\nA European\nClimate Pact\nMobilising research\nand fostering innovation\nIncreasing the EU's Climate\nambition for 2030 and 2050\nSupplying clean, affordable\nand secure energy\nA zero pollution ambition\nfor a toxic-free environment\n\n...\n\nTo accelerate the shift to sustainable mobility in Europe, revisions to the EU ETS \naim to help reduce emissions from aviation, while the new EU ETS 2 will cover road \ntransport. Under the Fit for 55 policy package, the EU has adopted the regulation on \nCO2 emission performance standards. It sets binding targets, notably for a 100% \nreduction in emissions from new cars and vans by 2035 along with regulations on \nshipping and aviation. In addition, the emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles set \nby Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 were revised and the amendments to the regulation \nentered into force on 26 June 2024.\nAdapting to climate change\nEnsuring that Europe can adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change is \na cross-cutting theme in the EGD. The EU Adaptation Strategy, adopted in 2021, \naims to make adaptation smarter, swifter and more systemic; it also aims to step \nup international action on adaptation to climate change. This should primarily be \nachieved through improved national adaptation strategies and plans. In 2024 the EC \nresponded to the EEAs European Climate Risk Assessment(18) with a communication \non managing climate risks. The Communication identified key principles for climate \nresilience, including:\n Avoiding maladaptation to ensure that resilience measures do not shift risks onto \nothers or worsen future risks;\n Systemic action involving cross-sectoral solutions to address interlinked climate \nrisks; and\n Transformational change to ensure that adaptation is ambitious, inclusive, and \ndoes not lead to social and economic disparities.\nAdditionally, the EU has increased funding to support people and regions \naffected by increasingly frequent climate events through the EU Solidarity Fund, \nNextGenerationEU and the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.\n\nThe evolving European policy framework\n51\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nZero pollution and a circular economy\nTo deliver on the ambition for a zero-pollution ambition for a toxic-free environment, \nthe Zero Pollution Action Plan was adopted in 2021, establishing targets to speed \nup pollution reduction at source. Under this umbrella, the revised urban wastewater \ntreatment directive, ambitious new rules for ambient air quality and the Euro 7 \nregulation have all been adopted, while new rules have been agreed on toy safety and \non detergents and surfactants.\nProgress was made on reducing microplastic pollution; restrictions on microplastics \nbeing added to products have been adopted and a proposal has been made to \nintroduce further measures to prevent pellet losses in the environment.\nThe ECs Chemical Strategy for Sustainability sets out the goal to better protect\n\n...\n\nof failure to implement EU environmental laws through air and water pollution, \nnature degradation and waste are estimated at EUR 180 billion per year for the EU; \napproximately 1% of EU GDP . Effective and full implementation of environmental \npolicies could cut these costs, while ensuring a level playing field for companies \nacross the EU single market(24).\nA recent report from the ECs Joint Research Centre provides a comprehensive \nassessment of progress towards 154 binding and non-binding policy targets set out \nunder the EGD. Targets cover key sectors, including climate, energy, circular economy, \ntransport, agriculture and food, ecosystems and biodiversity, water, soil and air \npollution. There has been progress on 62% of targets and 21% are well on track. As \nof mid-2024, 32 of the 154 targets are currently on track, 64 fall into the acceleration \nneeded category and 15 are found to be not progressing or regressing. For 43 of \nthe targets, no data are currently available(25).\n\nThe evolving European policy framework\n54\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n2.4\t The\tEUs\tglobal\trole\taround\tthe\tenvironment\tand\tclimate\nThe EUs ambitious climate targets and high environmental standards have made \nEurope a credible leader and advocate for increased ambition globally. On the \ninternational stage, the EU has been active in securing multi-national agreements that \nprovide the foundation for global action on climate change and biodiversity loss. The \nEU has led the way on climate change, contributed to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) processes and played a key role in \nsecuring the Paris Agreement. The EU was also a driver of the Kunming-Montreal \nGlobal Biodiversity Framework(26). Furthermore, it is involved in ongoing negotiations \nto develop a global agreement on plastics pollution(27).\nBox 2.5\nThe Paris Agreement and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework\nThe Paris Agreement (2015)\nThe Paris Agreement, adopted under the UNFCCC, is a cornerstone of global climate \naction. It aims to:\n limit global temperature rise to well below 2\u00b0C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C; \n enhance resilience and strengthen adaptation to climate impacts and reduce \nvulnerabilities; and \n mobilise public and private investments in support of low-emission, \nclimate-resilient\u00a0pathways. \nThe agreement requires countries to submit and update Nationally-Determined \nContributions (NDCs) every 5 years to ensure progress and ambition. The EU submitted\n\n...\n\nAt the same time, the EC will propose \nfurther amendments to the CBAM regulation to extend the scope to further downstream \nproducts and introduce additional anti-circumvention measures.\nIn parallel, the EU continues to further support the decarbonisation efforts of partner \ncountries through technical assistance and regulatory cooperation. For example, the \nInternational Carbon Markets and Carbon Pricing Diplomacy Task Force supports partner \ncountries in developing effective carbon pricing policies and robust approaches to \ninternational carbon markets.\nThe carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will apply from 2026 and aims to \nprevent carbon leakage by ensuring that the carbon price of imports is equivalent to \nthe carbon price of domestic production (see Box 2.6).\n\n\n\n57\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n3 Europes environment and climate: state and\u00a0outlook\nKey messages\n Europe is the fastest-warming continent in the world and its climate \nis changing at an alarming rate, threatening security, public health, \necosystems, infrastructure and the economy. Over 240,000 people \ndied because of weather- and climate-related extreme events from \n1980 to 2023 in the EU-27. Weather- and climate-related extremes \ncaused economic losses estimated at EUR2023 738 billion in the EU-27 \nfrom 1980 to 2023, with over EUR2023 162 billion in costs from 2021 to \n2023 alone. The insurance protection gap across Europe is substantial, \nwith most countries reporting over 50% of losses as\u00a0uninsured.\n Managing the climate crisis requires a dual approach: increasing \nresilience and mitigating climate change. Europe must accelerate \nits implementation of adaptation measures to avoid future costs \nand consequences linked to climate change. At the same time, it \nmust continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase \ncarbon\u00a0removals.\n Europe is a world leader in mitigating climate change. The EU has \nsuccessfully cut net domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 37% \nsince 1990, due to reductions in fossil fuel use and doubling the share \nof renewables since 2005. This provides a model for how climate \naction can boost competitiveness and energy security by lowering \ndependency on imported fossil fuels and increasing the share of \ndomestically produced renewable energy.\n Biodiversity is in poor condition across terrestrial, freshwater and \nmarine ecosystems in Europe due to persistent pressures from \nproduction and consumption systems, most notably the food system. \nOverall, 81% of protected habitats are in a poor or bad state, 60-70% of \nsoils are degraded and 62% of water bodies are not in good ecological \nstatus. Past policy targets have not been met and it is unlikely that\n\n...\n\nquarter of total energy use, \nstrengthening Europe's\nenergy independence\nThe EU is largely on track\n to meet the agreed targets \nfor 2030 if full implementation \nof policies is ensured\nAll European \nMember States\nhave dedicated\nadaptation policies \nin place\nDeployment of \nclean technologies\nis decarbonising Europe \nwhile increasing \ncompetitiveness\u00a0\nand resilience\nEU successfully \nphased out \nozone-depleting\nsubstances\n\n\nEuropes environment and climate: state and outlook \n77\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nWhat is the EU doing?\nThe EU is addressing climate risks through both climate change mitigation and \nadaptation strategies. The EUs legal framework, established under the European \nClimate Law(91), sets a binding target to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 at the \nlatest, with the interim target of reducing net GHG emissions by at least 55% by \n2030 compared to 1990 levels. These targets are reinforced by a robust policy \nand legal framework, including binding GHG emission reduction and removal \ntargets for Member States (with the effort sharing regulation (ESR) and land use, \nland use change and forestry (LULUCF) regulation), the European-wide emissions \ntrading system (ETS), a detailed climate and energy governance framework and a \ncomprehensive set of supplementary legislation addressing diverse sectors, many of \nwhich are established as part of the Fit for 55 package.\nAt the same time, the European Climate Law acknowledges that, while critical, \nmitigation alone is not enough. Adaptation is recognised as a key component of \nEuropes long-term global response to climate change and requires Member States \nand the EU to enhance their adaptive capacity, strengthen their resilience and reduce \ntheir vulnerability to climate change. The ECs 2024 communication on managing \nclimate risks sets out a vision for stepping up action to improve our societal and \neconomic resilience and preparedness in the face of climatic conditions that have \nalready changed(92). The EU Preparedness Union Strategy aims to prevent and react \nto emerging threats and crises, including climate change among the growing security \nchallenges. Further, the EU Climate Adaptation Plan is currently in preparation, due \nto be published in late 2026. This plan is expected to outline specific measures to \nprepare for and address the already inevitable impacts of climate change.\nThe global dimension\nClimate change is a global problem, requiring global action on both mitigation and \nadaptation. Europe accounts for 6% of current global emissions and, in contrast \nto the declining GHG emissions in the EU, global GHG emissions are still on the\nrise, increasing by more than 60% since 1990(93). Within the framework of the Paris \nAgreement, the parties to the UNFCCC have set the target of limiting the global \ntemperature rise this century to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and to \npursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5\u00b0C. As global \nemissions continue to increase despite efforts in Europe, the global community \nmust\u00a0step up its climate action to reduce GHG emissions.\nThe Paris Agreement also established the global goal of enhancing adaptive capacity, \nstrengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change, with a view \nto contributing to sustainable development and ensuring an adequate adaptation \nresponse. To guide the achievement of the global goal, a framework of targets \nwas initiated by the UNFCCC parties (the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Framework \nfor Global Climate Resilience) and a 2-year UAEBel\u00e9m work programme on the \ndevelopment of indicators to measure the progress achieved towards those targets \nhas been ongoing since 2023(94).\nWhat is the current state at the European level?\nTable 3.2 compiles past trend assessments over the last 10 to 15 years, outlooks \n10 to 15 years ahead, and assessments of the prospects of meeting 2030 and \n2050 EU policy targets (where in place) from the nine thematic briefings related to \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation.

This is to be \nachieved through an integrated approach that focusses on multiple (climatic \nand non-climatic) hazards simultaneously, brings together all relevant actors \nacross all levels of government (local, regional, national, and EU), and brings \ntogether citizens, local communities, civil society, businesses, social partners and \nacademic\u00a0communities.\nNational climate risk assessments are increasingly used to inform the development \nof adaptation policy(24). All EU Member States have a national adaptation policy in \nplace; many also have regional or sectoral adaptation policies or action plans(101). \nIn 2024, 24 out of the 38 EEA member countries had legislative provisions \nfor adaptation; 18 countries had a standalone climate law, with an adaptation \ncomponent(102). The number of sub-regional authorities with adaptation plans in place \nhas also increased substantially over the past decade. For example, since April 2025, \nover 5,956 local authorities have been committed to action on adaptation under the \nEU Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy initiative(103).\nEU legislation, such as the floods directive or the water reuse regulation, have \nensured that some of the risks under climate change, such as floods and droughts, \nare addressed consistently across countries. At the same time, looking at other \nincreasingly pressing risks, only 21 out of the 38 EEA member countries have \nheat-health action plans in place setting out governance protocols and procedures \nto address the risks of extreme temperatures to human lives(104) and drought \nmanagement is regulated by legislation in only 19 EU Member States(105).\nThus, societal preparedness for weather extremes and other climate impacts is still \nlow; whilst appropriate governance structures and policies exist (Table 3.2), actual \nimplementation of measures is lagging substantially behind the rapidly increasing \nrisk levels(24). The extent to which we can avoid damages will largely depend on how \nquickly we can reduce global GHG emissions, and how quickly and effectively we can \nprepare our societies and adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change(24).\nIn summary, to address the climate crisis effectively, Europe must accelerate both \nits mitigation and adaptation efforts. This requires urgent and decisive action at all\nlevels  global, national and local  to reduce vulnerabilities, enhance resilience and \nfacilitate transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy.\n3.2.3 Outlook and prospects for meeting policy targets\nAs the EU progresses towards climate neutrality, significant strides have been made \nin both mitigation and adaptation. However, challenges remain: the pace and scale of \naction need to accelerate to meet key targets.\nClimate change mitigation\nThe accelerated emission reductions witnessed over the past decades are expected \nto continue in the years ahead, and in their regular progress reporting, Member States \nare demonstrating growing ambition levels. Collectively, Member States project \nthat their current and planned additional policies and measures will deliver net GHG \nemission reductions converging towards the 2030 target of net 55 %. \n\nEuropes environment and climate: state and outlook \n82\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nMember States have finalised their updated National Energy and Climate Plans \n(NECPs) and integrated further Fit for 55 legislation. Together, they demonstrate how \nMember States collectively anticipate approaching the 2030 climate target of a net \n55% reduction. In the crucial years remaining to 2030, implementation of an array \nof EU and national policies and measures will be critical. This will require significant \ninvestment, with a need for public as well as private funding to be scaled up.\nBeyond 2030, the European Climate Law requires that a new emission reduction \ntarget is set for 2040 to put the EU on course for climate neutrality by 2050. The \nEuropean Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC) recommends EU \nemission reductions of 90-95% by 2040, relative to 1990 levels, in a science-based \nassessment that takes into account both fairness and feasibility(106).\nWith its proposed amendment to the European Climate Law in July 2025, the \nEuropean Commission (EC) echoed this scientific recommendation, proposing an \nadditional interim target of reducing the EUs net GHG emissions by 90% by 2040 \nrelative to 1990, based on an impact assessment(107).\nReducing net emissions by 90% by 2040 would put the EU on course towards climate \nneutrality by 2050. This would ensure predictability for citizens, businesses and \ninvestors by making sure that resources invested now and in the coming decades are \ncompatible with the EUs pathway to climate neutrality, avoiding wasted investments \nin the fossil fuel economy. At the same time, it would boost the competitiveness of \nEuropes businesses, create stable and future-proof jobs, enable the EU to lead the\n\n...\n\nkey\u00a0components.\nClimate change risks and adaptation\nWhilst the governance of climate change (the distribution of responsibilities and \npolicy development at the EU, national and subnational levels) offers reasons for \noptimism for future resilience to the climate crisis, the pace and scale of adaptation \nactions needs to increase. If Europe does not implement the solutions identified, it \nis still not adequately prepared to address the risks posed by climate change and \nthe societal and economic losses will remain or increase in the near future. Climate \nchange is projected to increase economic costs across Europe significantly, driven \nby more frequent and intense extremes and slow-onset impacts, with some regions \nfacing particularly high risks due to cascading and compounding effects(24). There is \nan urgent need to mainstream and upscale climate adaptation across sectors and \ngovernance levels to address the growing risks from extreme heat, drought, wildfires \nand flooding(24).\nThe current lack of measurable adaptation policy targets (cf. no targets under \nclimate risks to the economy and society in Table 3.2) and associated indicators \nmakes it difficult to assess the progress made and the future prospects. The \n\nEuropes environment and climate: state and outlook \n85\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nongoing development of the EUs Climate Adaptation Plan offers hope for a more \nlegislative-\u00a0and target-led approach to adaptation in the future.\nThe 2021 EUs Adaptation Strategy, promoting smarter, faster and more systemic \nadaptation, has called for the use of nature-based solutions for climate adaptation \nand disaster risk reduction. Applied at scale, such solutions could also enhance \nbiodiversity in urban and rural landscapes, with such measures foreseen under most \nurban adaptation plans in Europe(103). The EUs Adaptation Strategy also promotes a \nwider use of drought management plans, measures to increase the water retention \ncapacity of soils and safe water reuse.\nIn this context, the water reuse regulation, applied from 2023, can contribute to \nadaptations designed to cope with more frequent and severe droughts. Expanding \nand replicating local initiatives, in combination with infrastructural and institutional \nmeasures, will be necessary to build resilience across Europe(110). The 2024 EC \ncommunication on managing climate risks firmly states that the ultimate goal of \nadaptation actions is to protect people and prosperity.\nYet other aspects emphasised in the EUs Adaptation Strategy, the 2024 EC \ncommunication on managing climate risks and the 2025 EU Preparedness Union \nStrategy  such as the focus on vulnerable groups and achieving just resilience\n\n...\n\nHowever, governance-related challenges \nare a persistent barrier to the implementation of adaptation actions in many \ncountries, even where well-developed governance frameworks are in place. These \nchallenges include difficulties in coordination due to financial, technical and \nhuman\u00a0limitations(112).\nAnother key barrier to the development and implementation of further adaptation \nsolutions relates to difficulty comparing adaptation versus inaction scenarios. EU \nefforts in Destination Earth (a highly-accurate digital model of the Earth \u00a0a\u00a0digital \ntwin  to model, monitor and simulate natural phenomena, hazards and the \nrelated human activities) offers a potential avenue for modelling the impacts of \nfuture\u00a0solutions.\nConsidering strained national budgets will remain, EU funds will continue to play \na major role in financing adaptation action for most Member States. Yet, whilst \nthe EU budget is on track to exceed its climate change mitigation and adaptation \nspending target of 30% between 2021 and 2027, the money invested in adaptation \nis not earmarked as such, resulting in an information gap on the actual spending. \nSome countries also report dedicated national adaptation funds to finance the \nimplementation of national or sectoral adaptation actions. However, it is very unclear \nto what extent the actions planned in the national adaptation plans have been \nimplemented, as countries are obliged to report on policies rather than measures.\nMeeting climate change mitigation and adaptation targets requires a concerted \neffort across all levels of governance. The EUs approach to climate action\u00a0\u00a0from \nits ambitious emission reduction targets to its increasing focus on climate \nresilience\u00a0\u00a0provides a strong framework for the future. However, achieving these \ngoals will require not only continued investment but also a commitment to equity, \nfairness and integration across sectors. As the EU works towards a carbon-neutral \nand climate-resilient future, the need for urgent and coordinated action has never \nbeen more\u00a0critical.\n3.2.4 Drivers and pressures\nTo address both climate adaptation and climate mitigation, it is essential to understand \nhow various sectors are not only impacted by climate change but also contribute to \nGHG emissions. Climate change affects key economic sectors in Europe\u00a0\u00a0agriculture/\nfood, forestry, energy, the built environment and transport/mobility\u00a0\u00a0while these same \nsectors also drive emissions that contribute to the climate crisis. In other words, the \neffects of climate change mitigation and adaptation are interconnected and have a \ndual impact on the different sectors in\u00a0society.\nClimate-related risks to sectors\nThe EU Member States and Iceland, Switzerland and T\u00fcrkiye most often report on \nagriculture, health biodiversity, and forestry as the key sectors affected by climate \nchange (Figure 3.5).\n\n...\n\npossible trade-offs from climate policies such as the burning \nof\u00a0biomass. \nHg and PAHs from burning coal for energy production widely pollute \nEuropes surface waters(15).\nTable 3.4 Pollution drivers and pressures by sector (cont.)\n\n\n\n113\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n4  Managing the dynamic between our economy \nand\u00a0our natural resources\nKey messages\n Europes economy is largely dependent on natural resources, in many \ncases imported from outside Europe. Environmental pressures from \nresource extraction, along with geopolitical instability, make it vital to \nrethink how we source and consume natural resources. \n The EU is one of the most intensively used land masses on the \nglobe, with 38.8% of land dedicated to agriculture, 35.3% to forests, \nand 5.8% to residential and urban areas. As such, there is a need \nto consider trade-offs across competing demands for land for \nbiomass production, carbon sequestration, renewable energy and \necosystem\u00a0restoration. \n Water pollution, over-abstraction and physical changes impact \nwater bodies, groundwater and wetlands, with climate change \nexacerbating these issues. Deterioration in water quality creates risks \nfor production-consumption systems, especially food, industry and \nenergy. Water stress affects 30% of Europe's territory and 34% of the \npopulation each year. This is likely to increase in the future due to \nclimate change. \n Raw materials feed Europe's industrial economy and sustain our \nhigh quality of life. Our food, housing and mobility systems together \naccount for more than 80% of the EUs total material footprint. \nDecarbonisation and electrification are driving demand for critical raw \nmaterials, for which the EU is heavily dependent on imports from a \nlimited number of non-European countries. \n Only 11.8% of all material demand in the EU is sourced from recycling, \nand the EU is still far from its ambition to double its circularity rate \nby 2030. Yet, circularity practices and business models, along with \npolicies to address high levels of consumption, can lower resource \nuse and reduce waste while reducing the EUs dependence on \nmaterial\u00a0imports. \n There is an urgent need to reduce material consumption within the \nEU, which is unsustainable and much higher than in most other \nworld regions. International supply chains mean that much of the \nenvironmental degradation driven by the extraction, processing \nand use of resources to fuel EU consumption occurs outside the \nEU. Efforts to reduce the EUs material footprint should address the \ndemand for resources along the entire value chain.\n\n...\n\nalign with public concerns by making these dimensions equal to economic concerns \nin high-level decision-making(162).\n\nA cause for hope: levers of transformative change\n228\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n6.4\t Securing\tEuropes\tnatural\twealth\tto\tdeliver\thealthy\tand\tprosperous\tlives\nOnly by mitigating and adapting to climate change and protecting and restoring \necosystems will we be able to maintain the high quality of life of European citizens. \nResponsible stewardship of our natural capital can ensure that we can meet peoples \nneeds today, while also maintaining and restoring Europes natural resources \nfor future generations. This entails recognising that these resources provide the \nfoundation for a prosperous, competitive, resilient and secure Europe in the future.\nClimate change is a serious threat already wreaking havoc today, with urgent action \nneeded to protect people from the impacts of droughts, floods, extreme heat and \nother climate impacts. Nature plays a key role in increasing resilience to climate \nchange in Europe, especially through nature-based solutions. Sustainable solutions \noffer a 'triple win' by:\n mitigating environmental pollution and supporting biodiversity;\n improving the health and well-being of populations; and\n fostering social cohesion and integration.\nDecarbonising the EU economy and embracing circularity will reduce the EUs \ndependence on imported energy and raw materials, and increase our strategic \nautonomy and security. This is also foreseen to create new jobs and reinforce the \nEUs position as a first leader on sustainability.\nLooking forward, the strategic goal of a sustainable dynamic between Europes \neconomy and the environment must be rooted in meeting peoples needs. To \nmaintain European living standards, it will be crucial to adopt a holistic view of \nprosperity that goes beyond competitiveness. Rather, prosperity should encompass \nthe quality of peoples livelihoods, their health and security, as well as long-term \nresilience to climate and environ", "blurb": "quarter of total energy use, \nstrengthening Europe's\nenergy independence\nThe EU is largely on track\n to meet the agreed targets \nfor 2030 if full implementation \nof policies is ensured\nAll European \nMember States\nhave dedicated\nadaptation policies \nin place\nDeployment of \nclean technologies\nis decarbonising Europe \nwhile increasing \ncompetitiveness\u00a0\nand resilience\nEU successfully \nphased out \nozone-depleting\nsubstances\n\n\nEuropes environment and climate: state and outlook \n77\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nWhat is the EU doing?\nThe EU is addressing climate risks through both climate change mitigation and \nadaptation strategies.
