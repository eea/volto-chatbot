These targets are reinforced by a robust policy \nand legal framework, including binding GHG emission reduction and removal \ntargets for Member States (with the effort sharing regulation (ESR) and land use, \nland use change and forestry (LULUCF) regulation), the European-wide emissions \ntrading system (ETS), a detailed climate and energy governance framework and a \ncomprehensive set of supplementary legislation addressing diverse sectors, many of \nwhich are established as part of the Fit for 55 package.\nAt the same time, the European Climate Law acknowledges that, while critical, \nmitigation alone is not enough. ><end||s><|s61|><Adaptation is recognised as a key component of \nEuropes long-term global response to climate change and requires Member States \nand the EU to enhance their adaptive capacity, strengthen their resilience and reduce \ntheir vulnerability to climate change. The ECs 2024 communication on managing \nclimate risks sets out a vision for stepping up action to improve our societal and \neconomic resilience and preparedness in the face of climatic conditions that have \nalready changed(92). The EU Preparedness Union Strategy aims to prevent and react \nto emerging threats and crises, including climate change among the growing security \n><end||s><|s62|><challenges. Further, the EU Climate Adaptation Plan is currently in preparation, due \nto be published in late 2026. This plan is expected to outline specific measures to \nprepare for and address the already inevitable impacts of climate change.\nThe global dimension\nClimate change is a global problem, requiring global action on both mitigation and \nadaptation. Europe accounts for 6% of current global emissions and, in contrast \nto the declining GHG emissions in the EU, global GHG emissions are still on the\n><end||s><|s63|><rise, increasing by more than 60% since 1990(93). Within the framework of the Paris \nAgreement, the parties to the UNFCCC have set the target of limiting the global \ntemperature rise this century to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to \npursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C. As global \nemissions continue to increase despite efforts in Europe, the global community \nmust step up its climate action to reduce GHG emissions.\nThe Paris Agreement also established the global goal of enhancing adaptive capacity, \nstrengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change, with a view \n><end||s><|s64|><to contributing to sustainable development and ensuring an adequate adaptation \nresponse. To guide the achievement of the global goal, a framework of targets \nwas initiated by the UNFCCC parties (the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Framework \nfor Global Climate Resilience) and a 2-year UAEBelém work programme on the \ndevelopment of indicators to measure the progress achieved towards those targets \nhas been ongoing since 2023(94).\nWhat is the current state at the European level?\nTable 3.2 compiles past trend assessments over the last 10 to 15 years, outlooks \n10 to 15 years ahead, and assessments of the prospects of meeting 2030 and \n><end||s><|s65|><2050 EU policy targets (where in place) from the nine thematic briefings related to \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation.

This is to be \nachieved through an integrated approach that focusses on multiple (climatic \nand non-climatic) hazards simultaneously, brings together all relevant actors \n><end||s><|s71|><across all levels of government (local, regional, national, and EU), and brings \ntogether citizens, local communities, civil society, businesses, social partners and \nacademic communities.\nNational climate risk assessments are increasingly used to inform the development \nof adaptation policy(24). All EU Member States have a national adaptation policy in \nplace; many also have regional or sectoral adaptation policies or action plans(101). \nIn 2024, 24 out of the 38 EEA member countries had legislative provisions \nfor adaptation; 18 countries had a standalone climate law, with an adaptation \ncomponent(102). ><end||s><|s72|><The number of sub-regional authorities with adaptation plans in place \nhas also increased substantially over the past decade. For example, since April 2025, \nover 5,956 local authorities have been committed to action on adaptation under the \nEU Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy initiative(103).\nEU legislation, such as the floods directive or the water reuse regulation, have \nensured that some of the risks under climate change, such as floods and droughts, \nare addressed consistently across countries. At the same time, looking at other \nincreasingly pressing risks, only 21 out of the 38 EEA member countries have \n><end||s><|s73|><heat-health action plans in place setting out governance protocols and procedures \nto address the risks of extreme temperatures to human lives(104) and drought \nmanagement is regulated by legislation in only 19 EU Member States(105).\nThus, societal preparedness for weather extremes and other climate impacts is still \nlow; whilst appropriate governance structures and policies exist (Table 3.2), actual \nimplementation of measures is lagging substantially behind the rapidly increasing \nrisk levels(24). The extent to which we can avoid damages will largely depend on how \nquickly we can reduce global GHG emissions, and how quickly and effectively we can \nprepare our societies and adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change(24).\n><end||s><|s74|><In summary, to address the climate crisis effectively, Europe must accelerate both \nits mitigation and adaptation efforts. This requires urgent and decisive action at all\nlevels  global, national and local  to reduce vulnerabilities, enhance resilience and \nfacilitate transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy.\n3.2.3 Outlook and prospects for meeting policy targets\nAs the EU progresses towards climate neutrality, significant strides have been made \nin both mitigation and adaptation. However, challenges remain: the pace and scale of \naction need to accelerate to meet key targets.\n><end||s><|s75|><Climate change mitigation\nThe accelerated emission reductions witnessed over the past decades are expected \nto continue in the years ahead, and in their regular progress reporting, Member States \nare demonstrating growing ambition levels. Collectively, Member States project \nthat their current and planned additional policies and measures will deliver net GHG \nemission reductions converging towards the 2030 target of net 55 %. \n\nEuropes environment and climate: state and outlook \n82\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nMember States have finalised their updated National Energy and Climate Plans \n><end||s><|s76|><(NECPs) and integrated further Fit for 55 legislation. Together, they demonstrate how \nMember States collectively anticipate approaching the 2030 climate target of a net \n55% reduction. In the crucial years remaining to 2030, implementation of an array \nof EU and national policies and measures will be critical. This will require significant \ninvestment, with a need for public as well as private funding to be scaled up.\nBeyond 2030, the European Climate Law requires that a new emission reduction \ntarget is set for 2040 to put the EU on course for climate neutrality by 2050. ><end||s><|s77|><The \nEuropean Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC) recommends EU \nemission reductions of 90-95% by 2040, relative to 1990 levels, in a science-based \nassessment that takes into account both fairness and feasibility(106).\nWith its proposed amendment to the European Climate Law in July 2025, the \nEuropean Commission (EC) echoed this scientific recommendation, proposing an \nadditional interim target of reducing the EUs net GHG emissions by 90% by 2040 \nrelative to 1990, based on an impact assessment(107).\nReducing net emissions by 90% by 2040 would put the EU on course towards climate \nneutrality by 2050. This would ensure predictability for citizens, businesses and \n><end||s><|s78|><investors by making sure that resources invested now and in the coming decades are \ncompatible with the EUs pathway to climate neutrality, avoiding wasted investments \nin the fossil fuel economy. At the same time, it would boost the competitiveness of \nEuropes businesses, create stable and future-proof jobs, enable the EU to lead the\n\n...\n\nkey components.\nClimate change risks and adaptation\nWhilst the governance of climate change (the distribution of responsibilities and \npolicy development at the EU, national and subnational levels) offers reasons for \noptimism for future resilience to the climate crisis, the pace and scale of adaptation \n><end||s><|s79|><actions needs to increase. If Europe does not implement the solutions identified, it \nis still not adequately prepared to address the risks posed by climate change and \nthe societal and economic losses will remain or increase in the near future. Climate \nchange is projected to increase economic costs across Europe significantly, driven \nby more frequent and intense extremes and slow-onset impacts, with some regions \nfacing particularly high risks due to cascading and compounding effects(24). There is \nan urgent need to mainstream and upscale climate adaptation across sectors and \n><end||s><|s80|><governance levels to address the growing risks from extreme heat, drought, wildfires \nand flooding(24).\nThe current lack of measurable adaptation policy targets (cf. no targets under \nclimate risks to the economy and society in Table 3.2) and associated indicators \nmakes it difficult to assess the progress made and the future prospects. The \n\nEuropes environment and climate: state and outlook \n85\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\nongoing development of the EUs Climate Adaptation Plan offers hope for a more \nlegislative- and target-led approach to adaptation in the future.\nThe 2021 EUs Adaptation Strategy, promoting smarter, faster and more systemic \n><end||s><|s81|><adaptation, has called for the use of nature-based solutions for climate adaptation \nand disaster risk reduction. Applied at scale, such solutions could also enhance \nbiodiversity in urban and rural landscapes, with such measures foreseen under most \nurban adaptation plans in Europe(103). The EUs Adaptation Strategy also promotes a \nwider use of drought management plans, measures to increase the water retention \ncapacity of soils and safe water reuse.\nIn this context, the water reuse regulation, applied from 2023, can contribute to \nadaptations designed to cope with more frequent and severe droughts. ><end||s><|s82|><Expanding \nand replicating local initiatives, in combination with infrastructural and institutional \nmeasures, will be necessary to build resilience across Europe(110). The 2024 EC \ncommunication on managing climate risks firmly states that the ultimate goal of \nadaptation actions is to protect people and prosperity.\nYet other aspects emphasised in the EUs Adaptation Strategy, the 2024 EC \ncommunication on managing climate risks and the 2025 EU Preparedness Union \nStrategy  such as the focus on vulnerable groups and achieving just resilience\n\n...\n\nHowever, governance-related challenges \n><end||s><|s83|><are a persistent barrier to the implementation of adaptation actions in many \ncountries, even where well-developed governance frameworks are in place. These \nchallenges include difficulties in coordination due to financial, technical and \nhuman limitations(112).\nAnother key barrier to the development and implementation of further adaptation \nsolutions relates to difficulty comparing adaptation versus inaction scenarios. EU \nefforts in Destination Earth (a highly-accurate digital model of the Earth  a digital \ntwin  to model, monitor and simulate natural phenomena, hazards and the \nrelated human activities) offers a potential avenue for modelling the impacts of \nfuture solutions.\n><end||s><|s84|><Considering strained national budgets will remain, EU funds will continue to play \na major role in financing adaptation action for most Member States. Yet, whilst \nthe EU budget is on track to exceed its climate change mitigation and adaptation \nspending target of 30% between 2021 and 2027, the money invested in adaptation \nis not earmarked as such, resulting in an information gap on the actual spending. \nSome countries also report dedicated national adaptation funds to finance the \nimplementation of national or sectoral adaptation actions. However, it is very unclear \nto what extent the actions planned in the national adaptation plans have been \n><end||s><|s85|><implemented, as countries are obliged to report on policies rather than measures.\nMeeting climate change mitigation and adaptation targets requires a concerted \neffort across all levels of governance. The EUs approach to climate action  from \nits ambitious emission reduction targets to its increasing focus on climate \nresilience  provides a strong framework for the future. However, achieving these \ngoals will require not only continued investment but also a commitment to equity, \nfairness and integration across sectors. As the EU works towards a carbon-neutral \n><end||s><|s86|><and climate-resilient future, the need for urgent and coordinated action has never \nbeen more critical.\n3.2.4 Drivers and pressures\nTo address both climate adaptation and climate mitigation, it is essential to understand \nhow various sectors are not only impacted by climate change but also contribute to \nGHG emissions. Climate change affects key economic sectors in Europe  agriculture/\nfood, forestry, energy, the built environment and transport/mobility  while these same \nsectors also drive emissions that contribute to the climate crisis. In other words, the \n><end||s><|s87|><effects of climate change mitigation and adaptation are interconnected and have a \ndual impact on the different sectors in society.\nClimate-related risks to sectors\nThe EU Member States and Iceland, Switzerland and Türkiye most often report on \nagriculture, health biodiversity, and forestry as the key sectors affected by climate \nchange (Figure 3.5).\n\n...\n\npossible trade-offs from climate policies such as the burning \nof biomass. \nHg and PAHs from burning coal for energy production widely pollute \nEuropes surface waters(15).\n><end||s><|s88|><Table 3.4 Pollution drivers and pressures by sector (cont.)\n\n\n\n113\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n4  Managing the dynamic between our economy \nand our natural resources\nKey messages\n Europes economy is largely dependent on natural resources, in many \ncases imported from outside Europe. Environmental pressures from \nresource extraction, along with geopolitical instability, make it vital to \nrethink how we source and consume natural resources. \n><end||s><|s89|>< The EU is one of the most intensively used land masses on the \nglobe, with 38.8% of land dedicated to agriculture, 35.3% to forests, \nand 5.8% to residential and urban areas. As such, there is a need \nto consider trade-offs across competing demands for land for \nbiomass production, carbon sequestration, renewable energy and \necosystem restoration. \n Water pollution, over-abstraction and physical changes impact \nwater bodies, groundwater and wetlands, with climate change \nexacerbating these issues. ><end||s><|s90|><Deterioration in water quality creates risks \nfor production-consumption systems, especially food, industry and \nenergy.

Yet, circularity practices and business models, along with \npolicies to address high levels of consumption, can lower resource \nuse and reduce waste while reducing the EUs dependence on \nmaterial imports. \n><end||s><|s92|>< There is an urgent need to reduce material consumption within the \nEU, which is unsustainable and much higher than in most other \nworld regions. International supply chains mean that much of the \nenvironmental degradation driven by the extraction, processing \nand use of resources to fuel EU consumption occurs outside the \nEU. Efforts to reduce the EUs material footprint should address the \ndemand for resources along the entire value chain.\n\n...\n\nalign with public concerns by making these dimensions equal to economic concerns \nin high-level decision-making(162).\n><end||s><|s93|><\nA cause for hope: levers of transformative change\n228\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n6.4\t Securing\tEuropes\tnatural\twealth\tto\tdeliver\thealthy\tand\tprosperous\tlives\nOnly by mitigating and adapting to climate change and protecting and restoring \necosystems will we be able to maintain the high quality of life of European citizens. \nResponsible stewardship of our natural capital can ensure that we can meet peoples \nneeds today, while also maintaining and restoring Europes natural resources \nfor future generations.
