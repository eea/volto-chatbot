Multiple economic, social, geopolitical and \n environmental crises are converging to pose systemic risks to our way of life.  Europe \nis warming twice as fast as the global average, with extreme weather events driven \n by climate change impacting peoples lives across Europe today.  At the same time, \n political realities across the world have undergone a seismic shift, and Russians war \n of aggression against Ukraine and other armed conflicts have focused minds and \n investments on defence and security.\n The European Union (EU) has responded to this volatile and insecure global context \n through its strategic policy framework to 2029  the Competitiveness Compass. \n The three areas for action set out in the compass  innovation, decarbonisation and \n security  all have strong environment and climate dimensions, with clean industry,\n energy system transformation, circular economy and reducing import dependencies \n as key priorities.\n Indeed, Europe is critically dependent on natural resources for economic security, \n to which climate change and environmental degradation pose a direct threat. \n Protecting our natural resources, mitigating and adapting to climate change, and \n reducing pollution will build the resilience of vital societal functions that depend \n on nature, such as food security, drinking water and flood defences.  The European \n Preparedness Union Strategy recognises the potential for risks to cascade between \n the natural, social and political domains in the context of extreme weather events, \n human-induced disasters and geopolitical crises.  Europe must stay on course with its \n green ambitions and implement the environment and climate policies agreed under \n the European Green Deal (EGD) to achieve its long-term vision of living well within the \n limits of our planet.\n In this context, Europes environment 2025 provides the most comprehensive \n picture of the environment, climate and sustainability available in Europe, building \n on data from across 38 countries.  Figure ES.1 summarises the results of this \n comprehensive assessment.\n Overall, important progress is taking place within climate change mitigation, while \n there is mixed progress around reducing pollution and transitioning towards the \n circular economy.  The greatest challenges exist around reducing biodiversity loss and \n ecosystem degradation, as well as adapting to accelerating climate change.  However, \n progress on a range of factors that enable the shift towards sustainability  such as \n innovation, green employment and sustainable finance - gives cause for hope.\n This executive summary unpacks these key trends and highlights insights from \n across the three products in Europes environment 2025; the 35 thematic briefings; \n the 38 country profiles; and this report.\n Biodiversity is declining across terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems \n in Europe due to persistent pressures driven by unsustainable production and \n consumption patterns, most notably the food system.  Key pressures include \n changes in land and sea use, the over-exploitation of natural resources, pollution and \n invasive alien species, as well as the increasingly severe impacts of climate change.\n \nExecutive summary  \n 9\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n More than 80% of protected habitats are in a poor or bad state, with 60-70% of soils \n degraded.

The past trend \n shows an improving picture and projected reductions put the EU on track to meet its \n 2030 goal of reducing net GHG emissions by at least 55% compared to 1990 levels.\n The EUs carbon sink related to land use, land use change and forestry has declined \n by about 30% compared to the last decade.  This is due to a combination of factors \n such as ageing forests, more frequent and widespread tree felling, and the increasing \n impacts of climate change and severe natural disturbances, including forest fires, \n droughts and pests.\n A wide variety of options exist to reverse this trend and enhance carbon removals \n in terrestrial ecosystems, with significant environmental and societal co-benefits. \n Adequate finance and improved monitoring will be key to enabling land practitioners \n to adopt changes in their management practices.\n In the energy system, all EU Member States have successfully reduced their \n reliance on fossil fuels and shifted towards more sustainable energy sources over \n the last decade, while increased energy efficiency has also brought down demand. \n In 2023, renewable energy sources represented over 24% of the EUs final energy use. \n This represents a historic high driven by EU policies to speed up the clean energy \n transition, including the European Climate Law, the Fit for 55 EU policy package and \n the REPowerEU plan.\n Nevertheless, fossil fuels remain the dominant source of energy  making up almost \n 70% of EU gross available energy use in 2023.  Further investment is needed to \n accelerate the deployment of renewables and enable a deeper transformation of the \n European energy system.\n Clear regulatory signals reinforced with consistent pricing can make low-carbon \n and circular choices cheaper, with the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies crucial \n to decarbonisation.\n There has also been progress in the EUs industrial system, where GHG emissions \n fell by more than 35% from 2005 to 2023.  Further decarbonisation will require \n large-scale electrification, a switch to hydrogen for certain industrial processes and \n the substitution of fossil fuel-based materials with renewable materials.\n Cuts in air emissions from industry have been driven by decades of pollution control \n legislation, as well as decarbonisation measures.  Nevertheless, industry remains a\n \n...\n\nthe EU-27.\n Weather- and climate-related extremes caused economic losses of assets estimated \n at EUR2023 738 billion in the 27 Member States of the EU over the period 1980-2023, \n with over EUR2023 162 billion in costs from 2021 to 2023 alone.\n As climate change accelerates the costs are growing, with the average annual \n economic losses associated with weather- and climate-related extremes in \n the 2020-2023 period being 2.5 times as high as in the preceding decade from \n 2010 to 2019.  At the same time, the insurance protection gap across Europe is \n substantial  with most countries reporting over 50% of losses as uninsured.  The \ngap has also been widening over time, as uninsured losses have grown at a faster \n rate than insured losses.\n Changing growing conditions and extreme weather events, particularly reduced \n water availability and quality, present risks to Europes food security, with southern \n Europe particularly hard hit.  In 2022 and 2023, severe drought in parts of Europe \n led to considerable agricultural losses that translated into higher food prices \n for consumers.\n Looking forward, there is an urgent need for Europes agricultural sector to adapt to \n extreme weather events to guarantee the EUs long-term food security.  There is a role \n for biodiversity in providing solutions for adaptation to changing climatic conditions \n for food production in Europe, for example as a source of drought-resistant species.\n The increasing frequency and magnitude of climate-related disasters, as well as \n the knowledge that the climate will continue to change even with the EUs ambitious \n mitigation efforts, underscores the urgent need to adapt European society and \n the economy, while at the same time ensuring that no one is left behind.  Socially \n vulnerable groups, such as older people, children, low-income groups and people with \n disabilities, are disproportionately burdened by climate change and do not always \n benefit fairly from adaptation responses.\n Action is needed to ensure that choices taken today are fit for the future climate, for \n example in areas like land-use planning and long-lived infrastructure.  It is essential to \n identify the assets at risk from climate-driven extreme weather events and develop \n \nExecutive summary  \n 12\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n strategies that will build social resilience to climate change.  Currently, around 12% of \n the European population lives in flood-prone areas, while 11% of healthcare facilities \n and nearly 15% of industrial facilities in Europe are sited in such areas.\n \n...\n\nprovide a clear pathway towards sustainability, with the focus now falling on \n implementing legislation agreed under the EGD in an effective and timely manner. \n Local and regional authorities are playing a critical role in implementing \n environment and climate legislation and translating policies into change on the \n ground. Transforming the EUs production and consumption systems requires \n coordinated policies and action across multiple levels of governance.  Across Europe, \n communities are increasingly taking action to become sustainable, with examples of \n good practice seen across the food, energy and housing sectors, as well as climate \n change adaptation.\n Efforts to restore habitats through nature-based solutions will, over time, build \n resilience in natural systems and enable both adaptation to and mitigation of \n climate change.  The Nature Restoration Regulation aims to restore at least 20% of \n the EU's land and sea areas by 2030; in particular those with the most potential to \n capture and store carbon and to prevent and reduce the impact of natural disasters.\n \nExecutive summary  \n 14\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n Healthy ecosystems help stabilise the climate at the global scale and build resilience \n at the local scale. ><end||s><|s3|><Forests, wetlands, peatlands and oceans act as carbon sinks \n helping mitigate climate change and regulate the Earths temperature.  Wetlands \n and floodplains provide natural flood protection, forests and urban green spaces \n help mitigate the effects of heatwaves and healthy soils enhance water retention, \n reducing the risks of droughts and avalanches.\n Increasing circularity and decarbonising production have the potential to reduce our \n dependencies on imports of energy and materials and therefore enhance Europes \n strategic autonomy.  By investing in the digital and green transition of European \n industry, Europe can become a global leader and a first mover in developing \n technologies to decarbonise hard-to-abate industries, in particular steel and cement.\n The EU has set the goal of bolstering the rapid deployment of technological \n innovations to gain competitive advantage.  Indeed, Europe is already a world leader \n in green innovation, with the EU and other European countries already account \n for almost 27% of cleantech international patent families from 2017 to 2021. \n Weaknesses in the innovation ecosystem and a fragmented Single Market currently \n present obstacles to commercialisation, however.

These include Russias invasion of \n Ukraine, hikes in the costs of living and a new political leadership in the United States \n (US) that is re-evaluating alliances and disrupting long-standing trade policies.  At the \nKey messages\n  Todays global, geopolitical landscape is characterised by multiple \n crises. In response, Europe is focused on security and defence, as well \n as boosting competitiveness, to deliver sustainable prosperity and \n maintain quality of life for European citizens. \n  Without environmental resilience, we cannot have long-lasting security. \n A broad understanding of security captures not only defence, but also \n the resilience of vital societal functions that depend on our natural \n environment.  Healthy and functional ecosystems underpin food and \n water security and build resilience to our changing climate.  A circular \n economy and shifting away from fossil fuels help Europe to reduce \n dependency on imports of raw materials and energy. \n  Climate change and pollution impact the lives of Europeans today. \n From 1980 to 2023, over 240,000 fatalities have been caused by \n weather- and climate-related extreme events in the EU-27, with more \n than EUR  730 billion in economic losses.  Pollution drives death and \n disease, with air pollution costing the EU EUR 600 billion annually in \n health costs and other damages, equal to 4% of GDP .  \n  Environmental degradation and climate change threaten Europe's \n economy.

The sobering conclusion is that \n without massive investment and scaled-up action, it will be extremely hard to achieve \n the SDGs.\n 2.2\t The\tEuropean\tGreen\tDeal\n Under EC President Ursula von der Leyens first mandate, from 2019 to 2024, the \n legislative agenda was shaped by the aspirations of the European Green Deal (EGD). \n This ambitious policy package aims to set the EU on the path to becoming the first \n climate-neutral continent by 2050, with resource use decoupled from economic \n growth, and no person and no place left behind.  It aims to protect, conserve and \n enhance the EU's natural environment, and protect the health and well-being of \n citizens in the face of environment-related risks and impacts.  At the same time, it \n aims to ensure that the transition is just and inclusive.\n Acknowledging the severity and urgency of climate change and environmental \n degradation, the EGD reflects the paradigm shift called for by the EEA in its SOER \n 2020 report(16) by setting out to transform key systems in the European economy. \n This ambition reaches beyond sectoral approaches to mainstream sustainability \n \nThe evolving European policy framework\n 49\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n across all policy areas and transform Europes core production and consumption \n systems (Figure 2.2).  Building on the EGD, the 8th Environment Action Programme \n (8th EAP) establishes a framework for action on environment and climate policy up \n to 2030, setting objectives for 2030 and the long-term 2050 objective of living well \n within planetary boundaries.\n In the context of the ECs new mandate, the Political Guidelines for 2024 to 2029 \n emphasise the ongoing importance of delivering on the legislative commitments \n agreed-upon under the EGD and of staying the course on its goals. ><end||s><|s5|><This section \n provides an overview of legislative developments in the environment and climate \n policy landscape under the EGD.\n Source: EC(17).\n Figure 2.2 Strategies under the European Green Deal\n Transforming the \n EU's economy for a \n sustainable future\n The EU as a \n global leader\n A European\n Climate Pact\n Mobilising research\n and fostering innovation\n Increasing the EU's Climate\n ambition for 2030 and 2050\n Supplying clean, affordable\n and secure energy\n A zero pollution ambition\n for a toxic-free environment\n \n...\n\nTo accelerate the shift to sustainable mobility in Europe, revisions to the EU ETS \n aim to help reduce emissions from aviation, while the new EU ETS 2 will cover road \n transport.  Under the Fit for 55 policy package, the EU has adopted the regulation on \n CO2 emission performance standards.  It sets binding targets, notably for a 100% \n reduction in emissions from new cars and vans by 2035 along with regulations on \n shipping and aviation.  In addition, the emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles set \n by Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 were revised and the amendments to the regulation \n entered into force on 26 June 2024.\n Adapting to climate change\n Ensuring that Europe can adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change is \n a cross-cutting theme in the EGD.  The EU Adaptation Strategy, adopted in 2021, \n aims to make adaptation smarter, swifter and more systemic; it also aims to step \n up international action on adaptation to climate change.  This should primarily be \n achieved through improved national adaptation strategies and plans.  In 2024 the EC \n responded to the EEAs European Climate Risk Assessment(18) with a communication \n on managing climate risks.  The Communication identified key principles for climate \n resilience, including:\n  Avoiding maladaptation to ensure that resilience measures do not shift risks onto \n others or worsen future risks;\n  Systemic action involving cross-sectoral solutions to address interlinked climate \n risks; and\n  Transformational change to ensure that adaptation is ambitious, inclusive, and \n does not lead to social and economic disparities.\n Additionally, the EU has increased funding to support people and regions \n affected by increasingly frequent climate events through the EU Solidarity Fund, \n NextGenerationEU and the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.\n \nThe evolving European policy framework\n 51\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n Zero pollution and a circular economy\n To deliver on the ambition for a zero-pollution ambition for a toxic-free environment, \n the Zero Pollution Action Plan was adopted in 2021, establishing targets to speed \n up pollution reduction at source.  Under this umbrella, the revised urban wastewater \n treatment directive, ambitious new rules for ambient air quality and the Euro 7 \n regulation have all been adopted, while new rules have been agreed on toy safety and \n on detergents and surfactants.\n Progress was made on reducing microplastic pollution; restrictions on microplastics \n being added to products have been adopted and a proposal has been made to \n introduce further measures to prevent pellet losses in the environment.\n The ECs Chemical Strategy for Sustainability sets out the goal to better protect\n \n...\n\nof failure to implement EU environmental laws through air and water pollution, \n nature degradation and waste are estimated at EUR 180 billion per year for the EU; \n approximately 1% of EU GDP .  Effective and full implementation of environmental \n policies could cut these costs, while ensuring a level playing field for companies \n across the EU single market(24).\n A recent report from the ECs Joint Research Centre provides a comprehensive \n assessment of progress towards 154 binding and non-binding policy targets set out \n under the EGD.  Targets cover key sectors, including climate, energy, circular economy, \n transport, agriculture and food, ecosystems and biodiversity, water, soil and air \n pollution.  There has been progress on 62% of targets and 21% are well on track.  As \nof mid-2024, 32 of the 154 targets are currently on track, 64 fall into the acceleration \n needed category and 15 are found to be not progressing or regressing.  For 43 of \n the targets, no data are currently available(25).\n \nThe evolving European policy framework\n 54\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n 2.4\t The\tEUs\tglobal\trole\taround\tthe\tenvironment\tand\tclimate\n The EUs ambitious climate targets and high environmental standards have made \n Europe a credible leader and advocate for increased ambition globally.  On the \ninternational stage, the EU has been active in securing multi-national agreements that \n provide the foundation for global action on climate change and biodiversity loss.  The \nEU has led the way on climate change, contributed to the United Nations Framework \n Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) processes and played a key role in \n securing the Paris Agreement.  The EU was also a driver of the Kunming-Montreal \n Global Biodiversity Framework(26).  Furthermore, it is involved in ongoing negotiations \n to develop a global agreement on plastics pollution(27).\n Box 2.5\nThe Paris Agreement and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework\n The Paris Agreement (2015)\n><end||s><|s6|><The Paris Agreement, adopted under the UNFCCC, is a cornerstone of global climate \n action. It aims to:\n  limit global temperature rise to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C; \n  enhance resilience and strengthen adaptation to climate impacts and reduce \n vulnerabilities; and \n  mobilise public and private investments in support of low-emission, \n climate-resilient pathways. \n The agreement requires countries to submit and update Nationally-Determined \n Contributions (NDCs) every 5 years to ensure progress and ambition.

For example, the \n International Carbon Markets and Carbon Pricing Diplomacy Task Force supports partner \n countries in developing effective carbon pricing policies and robust approaches to \n international carbon markets.\n The carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will apply from 2026 and aims to \n prevent carbon leakage by ensuring that the carbon price of imports is equivalent to \n the carbon price of domestic production (see Box 2.6).\n \n\n\n57\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n 3 Europes environment and climate: state and outlook\n Key messages\n  Europe is the fastest-warming continent in the world and its climate \n is changing at an alarming rate, threatening security, public health, \n ecosystems, infrastructure and the economy.  Over 240,000 people \n died because of weather- and climate-related extreme events from \n 1980 to 2023 in the EU-27.  Weather- and climate-related extremes \n caused economic losses estimated at EUR2023 738 billion in the EU-27 \n from 1980 to 2023, with over EUR2023 162 billion in costs from 2021 to \n 2023 alone.  The insurance protection gap across Europe is substantial, \n with most countries reporting over 50% of losses as uninsured.\n  Managing the climate crisis requires a dual approach: increasing \n resilience and mitigating climate change.  Europe must accelerate \n its implementation of adaptation measures to avoid future costs \n and consequences linked to climate change.  At the same time, it \n must continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase \n carbon removals.\n  Europe is a world leader in mitigating climate change.  The EU has \n successfully cut net domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 37% \n since 1990, due to reductions in fossil fuel use and doubling the share \n of renewables since 2005.  This provides a model for how climate \n action can boost competitiveness and energy security by lowering \n dependency on imported fossil fuels and increasing the share of \n domestically produced renewable energy.\n  Biodiversity is in poor condition across terrestrial, freshwater and \n marine ecosystems in Europe due to persistent pressures from \n production and consumption systems, most notably the food system. \n Overall, 81% of protected habitats are in a poor or bad state, 60-70% of \n soils are degraded and 62% of water bodies are not in good ecological \n status.

The EUs legal framework, established under the European \n Climate Law(91), sets a binding target to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 at the \n latest, with the interim target of reducing net GHG emissions by at least 55% by \n 2030 compared to 1990 levels.  These targets are reinforced by a robust policy \n and legal framework, including binding GHG emission reduction and removal \n targets for Member States (with the effort sharing regulation (ESR) and land use, \n land use change and forestry (LULUCF) regulation), the European-wide emissions \n trading system (ETS), a detailed climate and energy governance framework and a \n comprehensive set of supplementary legislation addressing diverse sectors, many of \n which are established as part of the Fit for 55 package.\n At the same time, the European Climate Law acknowledges that, while critical, \n mitigation alone is not enough. ><end||s><|s7|><Adaptation is recognised as a key component of \n Europes long-term global response to climate change and requires Member States \n and the EU to enhance their adaptive capacity, strengthen their resilience and reduce \n their vulnerability to climate change.  The ECs 2024 communication on managing \n climate risks sets out a vision for stepping up action to improve our societal and \n economic resilience and preparedness in the face of climatic conditions that have \n already changed(92).  The EU Preparedness Union Strategy aims to prevent and react \n to emerging threats and crises, including climate change among the growing security \n challenges.  Further, the EU Climate Adaptation Plan is currently in preparation, due \n to be published in late 2026.  This plan is expected to outline specific measures to \n prepare for and address the already inevitable impacts of climate change.\n The global dimension\n Climate change is a global problem, requiring global action on both mitigation and \n adaptation.  Europe accounts for 6% of current global emissions and, in contrast \n to the declining GHG emissions in the EU, global GHG emissions are still on the\n rise, increasing by more than 60% since 1990(93).  Within the framework of the Paris \n Agreement, the parties to the UNFCCC have set the target of limiting the global \n temperature rise this century to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to \n pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C.  As global \n emissions continue to increase despite efforts in Europe, the global community \n must step up its climate action to reduce GHG emissions.\n The Paris Agreement also established the global goal of enhancing adaptive capacity, \n strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change, with a view \n to contributing to sustainable development and ensuring an adequate adaptation \n response.  To guide the achievement of the global goal, a framework of targets \n was initiated by the UNFCCC parties (the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Framework \n for Global Climate Resilience) and a 2-year UAEBelém work programme on the \n development of indicators to measure the progress achieved towards those targets \n has been ongoing since 2023(94).\n What is the current state at the European level?\n Table 3.2 compiles past trend assessments over the last 10 to 15 years, outlooks \n 10 to 15 years ahead, and assessments of the prospects of meeting 2030 and \n 2050 EU policy targets (where in place) from the nine thematic briefings related to \n climate change mitigation and adaptation.

This is to be \n achieved through an integrated approach that focusses on multiple (climatic \n and non-climatic) hazards simultaneously, brings together all relevant actors \n><end||s><|s8|><across all levels of government (local, regional, national, and EU), and brings \n together citizens, local communities, civil society, businesses, social partners and \n academic communities.\n National climate risk assessments are increasingly used to inform the development \n of adaptation policy(24).  All EU Member States have a national adaptation policy in \n place; many also have regional or sectoral adaptation policies or action plans(101). \n In 2024, 24 out of the 38 EEA member countries had legislative provisions \n for adaptation; 18 countries had a standalone climate law, with an adaptation \n component(102).  The number of sub-regional authorities with adaptation plans in place \n has also increased substantially over the past decade.  For example, since April 2025, \n over 5,956 local authorities have been committed to action on adaptation under the \n EU Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy initiative(103).\n EU legislation, such as the floods directive or the water reuse regulation, have \n ensured that some of the risks under climate change, such as floods and droughts, \n are addressed consistently across countries.  At the same time, looking at other \n increasingly pressing risks, only 21 out of the 38 EEA member countries have \n heat-health action plans in place setting out governance protocols and procedures \n to address the risks of extreme temperatures to human lives(104) and drought \n management is regulated by legislation in only 19 EU Member States(105).\n Thus, societal preparedness for weather extremes and other climate impacts is still \n low; whilst appropriate governance structures and policies exist (Table 3.2), actual \n implementation of measures is lagging substantially behind the rapidly increasing \n risk levels(24).  The extent to which we can avoid damages will largely depend on how \n quickly we can reduce global GHG emissions, and how quickly and effectively we can \n prepare our societies and adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change(24).\n In summary, to address the climate crisis effectively, Europe must accelerate both \n its mitigation and adaptation efforts.  This requires urgent and decisive action at all\n levels  global, national and local  to reduce vulnerabilities, enhance resilience and \n facilitate transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy.\n 3.2.3 Outlook and prospects for meeting policy targets\n As the EU progresses towards climate neutrality, significant strides have been made \n in both mitigation and adaptation.  However, challenges remain: the pace and scale of \n action need to accelerate to meet key targets.\n Climate change mitigation\n The accelerated emission reductions witnessed over the past decades are expected \n to continue in the years ahead, and in their regular progress reporting, Member States \n are demonstrating growing ambition levels.  Collectively, Member States project \n that their current and planned additional policies and measures will deliver net GHG \n emission reductions converging towards the 2030 target of net 55 %. \n \nEuropes environment and climate: state and outlook \n 82\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n Member States have finalised their updated National Energy and Climate Plans \n (NECPs) and integrated further Fit for 55 legislation.  Together, they demonstrate how \n Member States collectively anticipate approaching the 2030 climate target of a net \n 55% reduction.  In the crucial years remaining to 2030, implementation of an array \n of EU and national policies and measures will be critical.  This will require significant \n investment, with a need for public as well as private funding to be scaled up.\n Beyond 2030, the European Climate Law requires that a new emission reduction \n target is set for 2040 to put the EU on course for climate neutrality by 2050.  The \nEuropean Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC) recommends EU \n emission reductions of 90-95% by 2040, relative to 1990 levels, in a science-based \n assessment that takes into account both fairness and feasibility(106).\n With its proposed amendment to the European Climate Law in July 2025, the \n European Commission (EC) echoed this scientific recommendation, proposing an \n additional interim target of reducing the EUs net GHG emissions by 90% by 2040 \n relative to 1990, based on an impact assessment(107).\n Reducing net emissions by 90% by 2040 would put the EU on course towards climate \n neutrality by 2050.  This would ensure predictability for citizens, businesses and \n investors by making sure that resources invested now and in the coming decades are \n compatible with the EUs pathway to climate neutrality, avoiding wasted investments \n in the fossil fuel economy.  At the same time, it would boost the competitiveness of \n Europes businesses, create stable and future-proof jobs, enable the EU to lead the\n \n...\n\nkey components.\n Climate change risks and adaptation\n Whilst the governance of climate change (the distribution of responsibilities and \n policy development at the EU, national and subnational levels) offers reasons for \n optimism for future resilience to the climate crisis, the pace and scale of adaptation \n actions needs to increase.  If Europe does not implement the solutions identified, it \n is still not adequately prepared to address the risks posed by climate change and \n the societal and economic losses will remain or increase in the near future.  Climate \n change is projected to increase economic costs across Europe significantly, driven \n by more frequent and intense extremes and slow-onset impacts, with some regions \n facing particularly high risks due to cascading and compounding effects(24).  There is \n an urgent need to mainstream and upscale climate adaptation across sectors and \n governance levels to address the growing risks from extreme heat, drought, wildfires \n and flooding(24).\n The current lack of measurable adaptation policy targets (cf. no targets under \n climate risks to the economy and society in Table 3.2) and associated indicators \n makes it difficult to assess the progress made and the future prospects.  The \n\nEuropes environment and climate: state and outlook \n 85\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n ongoing development of the EUs Climate Adaptation Plan offers hope for a more \n legislative- and target-led approach to adaptation in the future.\n The 2021 EUs Adaptation Strategy, promoting smarter, faster and more systemic \n><end||s><|s9|><adaptation, has called for the use of nature-based solutions for climate adaptation \n and disaster risk reduction.  Applied at scale, such solutions could also enhance \n biodiversity in urban and rural landscapes, with such measures foreseen under most \n urban adaptation plans in Europe(103).  The EUs Adaptation Strategy also promotes a \n wider use of drought management plans, measures to increase the water retention \n capacity of soils and safe water reuse.\n In this context, the water reuse regulation, applied from 2023, can contribute to \n adaptations designed to cope with more frequent and severe droughts.  Expanding \n and replicating local initiatives, in combination with infrastructural and institutional \n measures, will be necessary to build resilience across Europe(110).  The 2024 EC \n communication on managing climate risks firmly states that the ultimate goal of \n adaptation actions is to protect people and prosperity.\n Yet other aspects emphasised in the EUs Adaptation Strategy, the 2024 EC \n communication on managing climate risks and the 2025 EU Preparedness Union \n Strategy  such as the focus on vulnerable groups and achieving just resilience\n \n...\n\nHowever, governance-related challenges \n are a persistent barrier to the implementation of adaptation actions in many \n countries, even where well-developed governance frameworks are in place.  These \nchallenges include difficulties in coordination due to financial, technical and \n human limitations(112).\n Another key barrier to the development and implementation of further adaptation \n solutions relates to difficulty comparing adaptation versus inaction scenarios.  EU \nefforts in Destination Earth (a highly-accurate digital model of the Earth  a digital \n twin  to model, monitor and simulate natural phenomena, hazards and the \n related human activities) offers a potential avenue for modelling the impacts of \n future solutions.\n Considering strained national budgets will remain, EU funds will continue to play \n a major role in financing adaptation action for most Member States.  Yet, whilst \n the EU budget is on track to exceed its climate change mitigation and adaptation \n spending target of 30% between 2021 and 2027, the money invested in adaptation \n is not earmarked as such, resulting in an information gap on the actual spending. \n Some countries also report dedicated national adaptation funds to finance the \n implementation of national or sectoral adaptation actions.  However, it is very unclear \n to what extent the actions planned in the national adaptation plans have been \n implemented, as countries are obliged to report on policies rather than measures.\n Meeting climate change mitigation and adaptation targets requires a concerted \n effort across all levels of governance.  The EUs approach to climate action  from \n its ambitious emission reduction targets to its increasing focus on climate \n resilience  provides a strong framework for the future.  However, achieving these \n goals will require not only continued investment but also a commitment to equity, \n fairness and integration across sectors.  As the EU works towards a carbon-neutral \n and climate-resilient future, the need for urgent and coordinated action has never \n been more critical.\n 3.2.4 Drivers and pressures\n To address both climate adaptation and climate mitigation, it is essential to understand \n how various sectors are not only impacted by climate change but also contribute to \n GHG emissions.  Climate change affects key economic sectors in Europe  agriculture/\n food, forestry, energy, the built environment and transport/mobility  while these same \n sectors also drive emissions that contribute to the climate crisis.  In other words, the \n effects of climate change mitigation and adaptation are interconnected and have a \n dual impact on the different sectors in society.\n Climate-related risks to sectors\n The EU Member States and Iceland, Switzerland and Türkiye most often report on \n agriculture, health biodiversity, and forestry as the key sectors affected by climate \n change (Figure 3.5).\n \n...\n\npossible trade-offs from climate policies such as the burning \n of biomass. \n Hg and PAHs from burning coal for energy production widely pollute \n Europes surface waters(15).\n Table 3.4 Pollution drivers and pressures by sector (cont.)\n \n\n\n113\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n 4  Managing the dynamic between our economy \n and our natural resources\n Key messages\n  Europes economy is largely dependent on natural resources, in many \n cases imported from outside Europe.  Environmental pressures from \n resource extraction, along with geopolitical instability, make it vital to \n rethink how we source and consume natural resources. \n  The EU is one of the most intensively used land masses on the \n globe, with 38.8% of land dedicated to agriculture, 35.3% to forests, \n and 5.8% to residential and urban areas.  As such, there is a need \n to consider trade-offs across competing demands for land for \n biomass production, carbon sequestration, renewable energy and \n ecosystem restoration. \n  Water pollution, over-abstraction and physical changes impact \n water bodies, groundwater and wetlands, with climate change \n exacerbating these issues.  Deterioration in water quality creates risks \n for production-consumption systems, especially food, industry and \n energy. Water stress affects 30% of Europe's territory and 34% of the \n population each year.  This is likely to increase in the future due to \n climate change. \n  Raw materials feed Europe's industrial economy and sustain our \n high quality of life.  Our food, housing and mobility systems together \n account for more than 80% of the EUs total material footprint. \n><end||s><|s10|><Decarbonisation and electrification are driving demand for critical raw \n materials, for which the EU is heavily dependent on imports from a \n limited number of non-European countries. \n  Only 11.8% of all material demand in the EU is sourced from recycling, \n and the EU is still far from its ambition to double its circularity rate \n by 2030.  Yet, circularity practices and business models, along with \n policies to address high levels of consumption, can lower resource \n use and reduce waste while reducing the EUs dependence on \n material imports. \n  There is an urgent need to reduce material consumption within the \n EU, which is unsustainable and much higher than in most other \n world regions.  International supply chains mean that much of the \n environmental degradation driven by the extraction, processing \n and use of resources to fuel EU consumption occurs outside the \n EU. Efforts to reduce the EUs material footprint should address the \n demand for resources along the entire value chain.\n \n...\n\nalign with public concerns by making these dimensions equal to economic concerns \n in high-level decision-making(162).\n \nA cause for hope: levers of transformative change\n 228\nEuropes environment and climate: knowledge for resilience, prosperity and sustainability\n 6.4\t Securing\tEuropes\tnatural\twealth\tto\tdeliver\thealthy\tand\tprosperous\tlives\n Only by mitigating and adapting to climate change and protecting and restoring \n ecosystems will we be able to maintain the high quality of life of European citizens. \n Responsible stewardship of our natural capital can ensure that we can meet peoples \n needs today, while also maintaining and restoring Europes natural resources \n for future generations.  This entails recognising that these resources provide the \n foundation for a prosperous, competitive, resilient and secure Europe in the future.\n Climate change is a serious threat already wreaking havoc today, with urgent action \n needed to protect people from the impacts of droughts, floods, extreme heat and \n other climate impacts.  Nature plays a key role in increasing resilience to climate \n change in Europe, especially through nature-based solutions.  Sustainable solutions \n offer a 'triple win' by:\n  mitigating environmental pollution and supporting biodiversity;\n  improving the health and well-being of populations; and\n  fostering social cohesion and integration.\n Decarbonising the EU economy and embracing circularity will reduce the EUs \n dependence on imported energy and raw materials, and increase our strategic \n autonomy and security.  This is also foreseen to create new jobs and reinforce the \n EUs position as a first leader on sustainability.\n Looking forward, the strategic goal of a sustainable dynamic between Europes \n economy and the environment must be rooted in meeting peoples needs.  To \nmaintain European living standards, it will be crucial to adopt a holistic view of \n prosperity that goes beyond competitiveness.  Rather, prosperity should encompass \n the quality of peoples livelihoods, their health and security, as well as long-term \n resilience to climate and environ\n ---\nDOCUMENT 3: Map 2 - European countries (EU-27, Iceland and Switzerland) that refer to justice considerations in their national reporting under the Governance Regulation of the Energy Union and Climate Action (Article 17 and 19) - 2023 | 2.7 Climate risks to society | Europe's environment 2025 (EEA)\n Source: Website\n The map shows which countries mention justice directly, indirectly or not at all, in their reporting under the Governance Regulation, 2023 reporting cycle.\n Data are based on information from country reports submitted under Articles 17 and 19 of the EU Governance Regulation from 2023.\n Downloads\n Data sources\n Metadata\n More info\n Map Package.zip\n No results found.\n Loading\n- Country Profiles under the Governance Regulation, 2023 , European Environment Agency (EEA)\n Topics\nClimate change adaptation Geographical coverage\n - Cyprus\n - Portugal\n - Spain\n- Malta\n- Denmark\n - Sweden\n - Netherlands\n - Austria\n - Belgium\n - Germany\n - Luxembourg\n - Ireland\n - France\n - Slovakia\n - Czechia\n - Italy\n- Slovenia\n - Croatia\n - Greece\n - Estonia\n - Latvia\n - Lithuania\n - Finland\n - Hungary\n - Bulgaria\n - Poland\n - Romania\n - Switzerland\n - Iceland Temporal coverage\n 2023 Publisher European Environment Agency Other organisations involved Ramboll\n Units\nN/A (countries are classified by one of three categories: direct mentions, indirect mentions, no mentions)\n Related content\n References and footnotes><end||s><end||context><|request|><Make one or more claims about information in the documents.><end||request><|response|><|r1|><**EU actions to combat climate change**\n><end||r><|r2|><\n| Action area | Main measures / policies | Targets / outcomes |\n><end||r><|r3|><|------------|--------------------------|--------------------|\n><end||r><|r4|><| **Mitigation – emission cuts** | • European Climate Law (binding 55 % net GHG reduction by 2030, climate‑neutrality by 2050) <br>• Fit for 55 package (tightening EU ETS, CO₂ performance standards for cars, heavy‑duty vehicles, aviation, shipping) <br>• Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) from 2026 to prevent carbon leakage <br>• Renewable energy push (24 % of final energy from renewables in 2023, historic high) | • Net‑55 % reduction vs 1990 by 2030 <br>• Proposed 90 % net reduction by 2040 (interim target) <br>• >35 % drop in industrial GHG emissions (2005‑2023) |\n><end||r><|r5|><| **Decarbonising industry & energy** | • Large‑scale electrification, hydrogen rollout, renewable material substitution <br>• Phase‑out of fossil‑fuel subsidies <br>• Support for clean‑technology innovation (≈27 % of global cleantech patents 2017‑2021) | • 24 % renewable share in final energy (2023) <br>• Fossil fuels still ~70 % of gross energy use – further investment needed |\n><end||r><|r6|><| **Adaptation & resilience** | • EU Adaptation Strategy (2021) – smarter, faster, systemic adaptation <br>• EU Preparedness Union Strategy – integrated climate‑risk management <br>• Funding via EU Solidarity Fund, NextGenerationEU, Civil Protection Mechanism | • All Member States have national adaptation policies; many have sectoral plans <br>• Goal to protect people, prosperity and critical infrastructure from climate extremes |\n><end||r><|r7|><| **Nature‑based solutions & biodiversity** | • Nature Restoration Regulation (aim to restore ≥20 % of land & sea by 2030) <br>• Circular‑economy actions (Zero‑Pollution Action Plan, micro‑plastic restrictions) | • Protected‑area extent increased over the past decade <br>• Ongoing effort to reverse biodiversity loss and improve ecosystem health |\n><end||r><|r8|><| **Governance & finance** | • EU ETS (including new ETS 2 for road transport) <br>• Governance Regulation (Article 17/19) – reporting on climate justice (see map of country mentions) <br>• Public & private financing mechanisms to scale mitigation & adaptation | • 62 % of 154 EGD targets on track (mid‑2024) <br>• 30 % of EU budget earmarked for climate‑related spending (2021‑2027) |\n><end||r><|r9|><\n*Key sources:* EU climate‑law targets, Fit for 55, CBAM, renewable‑energy share, adaptation strategy, nature‑restoration regulation, and funding programmes are described in the European environment report 2025 [[1]](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/europe-environment-2025/main-report/report/@@download/file). ><end||r><|r10|><The map of justice mentions under the Governance Regulation shows how countries report on climate‑justice aspects, supporting the governance pillar [[3]](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/europe-environment-2025/thematic-briefings/climate-change/climate-risks-to-society/european-countries-eu-27-iceland-and-switzerland).><end||r><end||response>"
